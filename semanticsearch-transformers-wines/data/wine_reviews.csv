There is a sizzle of acitity on the palate, where juicy strawberry and olallieberry flavors are easy to enjoy, made more complex by graphite and cedar touches.",Rideau 2014 Estate Syrah
118,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Sangiovese, this offers aromas of black currant, caramel and mocha. The dense palate delivers toast, leather and cedar alongside teeth-coating tannins that grip the finish.",Tenuta Forconi 2013 Toscano Red (Toscana)
119,"Medium-gold in color. Complex and inviting nose layered with a strong earthy minerality, vibrant bright fruit and intriguing notes of petrol and honey. On the palate it is racy, taut and focused full of well defined ripe succulent citrus and stone fruit. Rich, viscous texture perfectly balanced by the wine's crispness and almost steely minerality. Very long, juicy, lingering finish.",Dopff & Irion 2004 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace)
120,"Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring.",Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Prapó  (Barolo)
121,"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.",Matrix 2007 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
122,"Defines Rockpile Zinfandel in intensity of fruit and high alcohol which is in keeping with the volume. There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.",Mauritson 2007 Rockpile Cemetary Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
123,"The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018.",Henry's Drive Vignerons 2006 Parson's Flat Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway)
124,"This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.",Silverado 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
125,"Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.",Le Riche 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
126,"Mid-gold color. Pronounced and enticing aromas of ripe citrus and stone fruit, layered with honey and floral notes with a touch of sweet spice.

Very balanced.",Kuentz-Bas 2008 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
129,"A big, black bruiser of a wine that has black olive flavors and aromas and plenty beyond. Raspberry, mulberry, vanilla and spice all vie on the nose, while the palate is so dark it´s tough to discern the plum and leather flavors. Give it three years and reap the benefits.",Camberley 2004 Philosophers' Stone Red (Stellenbosch)
130,"At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass. The dark fruit is still dominant, but it is beginning to show some interesting tertiary aromas of earth, mushrooms and leather. Well balanced with a medium finish. Needs a few more years, but can be enjoyed now with a good deal of pleasure.",Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Brunate  (Barolo)
131,"Attractive mid-gold color. Compelling layers of tangy citrus and stone fruit aromas with notes of honey and earthy minerality.

Taut and focused.",Dopff & Irion 2008 Gentil White (Alsace)
132,"A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure. Flavors of cassis underly this, while the wood spices contribute their ribbon of flavor. This is an impressive wine, the flagship red from this estate founded by Spatz Sperling over 30 years ago.",Delheim 2001 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)
133,"Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage. Big rich, fat with smoked meat and a good dose of oak, the wine was one of the few that didn't peter out early but stayed on the palate to the end, culminating in an nice easy finish.",Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2003  Barolo
134,"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.",Clark-Clauden 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
135,"The color is just beginning to show signs of browning at the edge, but the wine is still fresh and vibrant. The nose is complex, showing licorice, summer fruits, caramel and roses. On the palate, it is soft and pleasant, but lacks some concentration.  At its peak, but will drink well for a few years.",Giacomo Ascheri 2001 Sorano  (Barolo)
136,"This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune—no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink now–2020. Imported by Acadia Imports.",Lassègue 2003  Saint-Émilion

Strong minerality prevails to a long, complex finish.",Kuentz-Bas 2007 Cuvée Jerémy Sélection de Grains Nobles Pinot Gris (Alsace)
140,"A big, fat, luscious wine with plenty of toasty oak, dark jammy fruit and spices. The palate showed the same lushness; with the fruit front and center with surprising length.  A delicious, rather hefty effort short on finesse but long on flavor.",Poderi Colla 2005 Costa Bruna  (Barbera d'Alba)
141,"This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar. On the palate the fruit seems a little heavier and more roasted, but still melds well with its earthy, mushroomy flavors. Medium finish.",Giacomo Ascheri 2003 Vigna dei Pola  (Barolo)
142,"A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing.

143,"Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality.

146,"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character.",Vincent Vineyards 2010 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
147,"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties.

152,"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents.

Drink through 2020.",Marques de Griñon 2010 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Graciano (Dominio de Valdepusa)
155,"Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.",Big Basin 2013 Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains)
156,"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb.

157,"From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine. It is firm, densely structured and with solid, dark tannins.

This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors.

207,"Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice.",Del Carlo Winery 2014 Home Ranch Teldeschi Vineyards Century Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
208,"A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% Sémillon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink now–2019.",Delaire Graff 2013 Reserve White (Coastal Region)
209,"Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now.",Domaine St Pierre 2014 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
210,"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now.",Eikendal 2014 Chardonnay (Western Cape)
211,"This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020–2025.",Famille Perrin 2013 Les Christins Red (Vacqueyras)
212,"Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile.",Matarromera 2015 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda)
213,"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.",MCV 2014 1105 Red (Paso Robles)
214,"This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.",Mounts 2014 Verah Red (Dry Creek Valley)
215,"Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish.",Or Haganuz 2014 French Blend Red (Galilee)
216,"Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019–2025.",Podere Scopetone 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
217,"Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018.",Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2013 Red (Beira Atlantico)
218,"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.",Robert Mondavi 2015 Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley)
219,"From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish.",Samuel Tinon 2015 Megyer Dry Furmint (Tokaj)
220,"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.",Sixteen by Twenty 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
221,"This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.",St. Pauls 2014 Passion Riserva Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
222,"Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018–2023.",Talenti 2011 Trentennale  (Brunello di Montalcino)
223,"Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish.",Terlan 2015 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
224,"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.",Mendel 2014 Lunta Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
225,"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",Oldenburg 2013 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
226,"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now.",Oldenburg 2014 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
227,"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.",Wagner 2006 Grace House Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
228,"A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.",Treleaven 2006 Semi-Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake)
229,"Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.",Benessere 2005 Costa Del Sol Red (Napa Valley)
230,"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.",Bloomer Creek 2006 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
231,"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.",Andean Sky 2007 Bonarda (Mendoza)
232,Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.,Angove's 2006 Red Belly Black Shiraz (South Australia)
233,"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.",Silvan Ridge 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
234,"Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous rosé eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry.",Talamonti 2007 Cerasuolo Rosè  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
235,"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.",Testarossa 2006 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
236,"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.",Meeker 2004 Kiss Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
237,"The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture.",Consorzio Vini Tipici di San Marino NV Moscato (San Marino)
238,"The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down—big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.",D'Arenberg 2006 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale)
239,"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.",Dogwood 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino)
240,"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.",Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Ugni Blanc-Colombard (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne)
241,"Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.",Falcor 2005 Sangiovese (Napa Valley)
242,"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture.",Hayman & Hill 2007 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
243,"This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment.",Hermann J. Wiemer 2002 Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
244,"Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine.",J. & F. Lurton 2007 Herederos de François Lurton Villafrance de Duero Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
245,"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.",Finca Las Moras 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (San Juan)
246,"Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.",Long Flat 2006 Destinations Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
247,"Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.",Work 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma Mountain)
248,"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.",Amity 2006 Estate Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
249,"Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.",Autumn Hill 2007 Petit Verdot-Merlot Red (Monticello)
250,"Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.",Blue Rock 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
251,"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.",Cherry Hill 2006 Papillon Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
252,"Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.",Cloud 9 2006 Seity Zinfandel (Amador County)
253,"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.",Cueva de las Manos 2007 Reserve Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
254,"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.",David Fulton 2008 Petite Sirah (St. Helena)
255,"Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.",Esterlina 2009 Reserva Pinot Noir (Cole Ranch)
256,"A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry. Fine, dusty tannins reminiscent of cocoa powder and dried crushed berries stay after swallow alongside a hint of sweet smoke flavor.",Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2008 Goat-Roti Syrah-Viognier (Coastal Region)
257,"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.",Graham Beck 2007 The William Red (Coastal Region)
258,"This wine strikes a superb balance between herbaceous, green notes and ripe black fruit, all graced with a kiss of sweet vanilla. Rich blackberry and cassis flavors flood the palate, but then transition to sweet smoke and oak flavors on the finish.",Hartenberg 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
259,"Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors. There is a herbal character as well as dark plum and sweet fruit flavors. Age for 2–3 years, the wine will always be firm.",Vignobles 46N118 2007 Noir 46 Malbec (Cahors)
260,"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.",Willamette Valley Vineyards 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
261,"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas.

262,"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.",Beaver Creek 2008 Fairytale Red (Napa Valley)
263,"A very good Pinot Noir, rich in cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. It's on the forward side, trading complexity and nuance in favor of immediate gratification. Drink now–2014.",Byron 2009 Monument Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
264,"A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat. Medium weight and lush, the creamy mouth transitions into a finish loaded with sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa.",Jardin 2007 Syrah (Stellenbosch)
265,"Fairly intense and flavorful, this Chard expresses assertive aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, buttercream frosting, lemon custard and toasted brioche. Medium weight in the mouth with good balance and a touch of baking spice on the close.",Jardin 2009 Nine Yards Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
266,"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla.

270,"A gorgeous expression of Friulano, this wine (in a screwcap bottle) makes an elegant addition to chicken, pasta or seafood dinners. Layers of peach, almond and pineapple are wrapped tightly together.",Livio Felluga 2009 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
271,"Lively aromas of lemon, grapefruit and melon start this white from Greece. Flavors of grapefruit and lemon rind are fresh and crisp but still offer dimension. The finish is spicy and clean. A great food wine: pair with grilled fish or clams.",My Big Fat Greek Wine 2010 Assyrtico (Santorini)

281,"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",Cambria 2011 Bench Break Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
282,"This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather.

283,"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries.

Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
284,"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.",Viña Cobos 2011 Marchiori Vineyard Block C2 Malbec (Perdriel)

It's a wine that is already ready to drink. Screwcap.",Josef Schmid 2011 Kremser Gebling Erste Lage Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
289,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors.

Your best bet is to drink up now.",Parallel 2010 Fortune Teller Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
290,"This is a wine that has great potential—you can tell from the firm tannins, tight acidity and closed texture. Initially, black currant flavors are touched with dark, dusty notes, but they finish with more juicy character on the afterntaste. Drink from 2017.",Château Lafon-Rochet 2011  Saint-Estèphe
291,"This powerful Sagrantino opens with aromas of meat juice, truffle and black fruit. The palate offers blackberry, black cherry, cinnamon and black pepper, along with tobacco notes.

293,"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.",Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
294,"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power.

It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses.",Benessere 2007 Estate Sangiovese (Napa Valley)

311,"This wine is light in color, but still packs a mouthful of flavor. It's peppery and meaty upfront, filled out on the midpalate by tart fruit that verges on cranberry in flavor. Pretty rather than potent; drink now-2014.",Otto's Constant Dream 2008 Syrah (Hawke's Bay)
312,"A good wine to drink now for its sweet, ripe berry and mocha flavors and smoky coat of oak. It has smooth tannins and a spicy finish. Give it a good decant to let it breathe for a few hours.",Mount Veeder 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

317,"Soft, ripe, dominated by peaches, pears and a rounded, toasty character. The spice is dominant, giving the wine an exotic edge. The more rounded style gives concentration as well as a fine, finishing velvet texture.",Château Tour de Mirambeau 2006  Bordeaux Blanc
318,"Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely.",Aresti 2007 Reserva Merlot (Curicó Valley)

331,"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find.

335,"There's a unique note here of mature fruit, chopped basil or peppermint with a hint of spice or chopped white peppercorn.

336,"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh.

344,"Aromas of pumpkin, squash and corn chips are stale and not inviting. There's an acceptable mouthfeel to this weird, unbalanced Chardonnay along with flavors of spiced squash, mealy apple and sautéed root vegetables.",Viña Tarapacá 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley)
345,"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely.

350,"After a few minutes in the glass, this stunning wine opens up to reveal classic Nebbiolo aromas of leather, tilled soil, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and ripe berry.

355,"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.",Rochioli 2014 Sweetwater Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
356,"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines.

Best after 2020.",Jasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote)
357,"Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future.

Drink from 2024.",Château de la Tour 2013 Vieilles Vignes  (Clos de Vougeot)
358,"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar.

It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come.",Weingut Hans Bausch 2011 Hattenheimer Hassel Auslese Riesling (Rheingau)
359,"Up the slope above the Grand Cru of Le Montrachet, this vineyard once grew hemp (hence the name, cheneve).

364,"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.",Winderlea 2014 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
365,"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley)
366,"This spends 12 months in oak and it shows: It offers aromas of liquid smoke and flavors of brown sugar, honey and caramel. The fruit is subdued, leaving the emphasis on the oak and mineral components. Try with rich but delicately flavored fish dishes or mild chèvres.",Cantina Terlano 2000 Vorberg Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
367,"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood.

380,"At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.",Lapostolle 2002 Estate Bottled Merlot (Rapel Valley)
381,It's testament to this wine's balance that it remains so alive and fresh long after many other Biancos have faded.

Best Buy.",Casa Julia 2001 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
391,"With full oak and pineapple aromas along with a big mouthful of spicy apple and pear fruit, this is no weakling. On the contrary, it's full and meaty, with a lot of texture and extract. The feel is healthy even if the acidity is on the low side. A very good wine to drink now; it probably won't age that well.",Valdivieso 2001 Reserve Chardonnay (Central Valley)
392,"A lovely wine, made even more attractive by the value price. It has flavors and lemons and limes and a ripe, sweet edge of honey, although it's technically dry. The acidity is clean and refreshing.",Bridlewood 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
393,"Strongly oaked, but fresh, young and healthy in the nose. The smell of coconut and lemon curd is friendly and soft, while the palate is loaded with more lemon, coconut, pear and nutmeg.

398,"On the plump but balanced side, with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB.

Decent quality; will get the job done.",Aresti 2008 Estate Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley)

511,"This potentially rich Champagne is still young. The Chardonnay and Pinot Noir that dominate the blend show tight acidity, minerality and a tangy, orange-like edge. Give it time to mature, and it will be splendid.",Boude Baudin 2010 Cuvée St Clément  (Champagne)

520,"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet.

It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.",Rex Hill 2014 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
523,"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish.

This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.",Le Cadeau 2015 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
533,"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch.

Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.",Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)

This finishes crisp, with punchy acidity.",Príncipe de Viana 2008 Reserva 1423 Red (Navarra)
605,"Mild berry and cherry aromas are standard and slightly oaky. The palate on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is choppy and tannic, while earthy flavors of cherry and plum are pushed by firm acids. This finishes tannic, with coffee and herbal flavors.",Proemio 2009 Gran Reserve Winemaker's Selection Red (Mendoza)
606,"It's rare to find a varietally labeled Grenache that comes in under 13% alcohol, but here you have it. Blended with 10% Syrah, it has notes of white pepper, smoked meat, savory spices and red fruit. What it lacks in terms of depth it makes up for in purity and elegance.",Quady North 2011 Bomba Grenache (Rogue Valley)
607,"Named after the blending of Steelhead Run and Ox vineyard blocks, this appealing wine is fresh and varietal with notes of ripe peach and herbs. Aged six months in stainless steel and coming in at a low 12% alcohol, the fruit concentration is lighter in style but still offers enjoyment.",Quady North 2011 Steel-Ox Viognier (Rogue Valley)
608,"Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc hangs together easily on this herb-dominant wine. The texture has a creamy character, showing green fruits, lively acidity and a bright orange-zest aftertaste.",Quinta do Portal 2012 Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc White (Douro)
609,"Grüner Veltliner, though still rare, shows good promise in Oregon. This is a big, sappy, ripe version that's borderline syrupy, with big flavors of peaches and apricots. But the supporting acids, and a lick of mineral, keep it from crashing.",Raptor Ridge 2012 Estate Grüner Veltliner (Chehalem Mountains)
610,"A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit. The alcohol is moderate, making it easy to drink.",Rodney Strong 2012 Charlotte's Home Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Northern Sonoma)

615,"Four years running this wine has scored 87 and been a Best Buy. The bouquet is scratchy but nicely aromatic, including hints of spice to go with ripe berry scents. The palate is jammy and home to rooty berry, mild spice and very light oak flavors. The finish is a bit hot and fiery, which food will tame.",Tilia 2011 Malbec (Mendoza)
616,"This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together.",B Cellars 2011 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)

622,"Mostly Syrah, with just a dash of Petite Sirah (2%) and Petit Verdot (1%), this red from Sawtooth and Skyline vineyards brings light notes of smoked meat, chocolate, and flowers.

624,"Named after the Nez Perce name for the Clearwater River, this blend is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Syrah thrown in the mix.

628,"This plush, full-bodied wine is already delicious, delivering wave after wave of savory fruit flavor, something like soy-marinated, char-grilled beef.

629,"Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley.

A warmth of spice lingers on the finish.",Walt 2013 Pinpoint Extreme Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
630,"From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel. At first a bit shy, this opens slowly and reveals hidden complexities and enduring length. Drink now through 2025.",WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Aliette Pinot Noir
631,"Lifted notes of honey and rose petal play on the nose, the palate is altogether more lively than the nose suggests: sprightly and fresh, concentrated and caramel-tinged with lemon freshness. This strikes an appetizing, moreish palate and makes for joyful drinking.",Willm 2011 Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
632,"Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine. The palate holds even more fruity nuance but is dry, concentrated and linear, being carried forward by zesty freshness and lemony overtones. This is clean, charming, taut and dry with a bracing nature and a clean, brisk finish.",Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Wineck-Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)

634,"From a two-acre block within the amazing Maple Vineyard planted in 1910, this wine also contains 10% Petite Sirah and 10% mixed blacks.

Drink now through 2021.",Armida 2013 Tina's Block Maple Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
635,"Aromas of wood grain, vanilla, butter and fino Sherry are elegant and attractive for this style of white Rioja.

Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",Torbreck 2010 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
637,"A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds.",Biecher & Schaal 2014 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace)
638,"A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone.

Drink 2016–2020.",Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Kitterlé Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
639,"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge.

There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane.",Domaines Schlumberger 2012 Kessler Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
640,"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic.

642,"This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte. With its rich black fruits and dense tannins, it's also a wine that is firmly structured.

646,"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Lagoalva Barrel Selection Tinto Red (Tejo)
647,"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by João Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.",Quinta do Monte Xisto 2013 Red (Douro)
648,"A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic spätlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon.

649,"With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy.

650,"You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white.

It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage.",Sturm 2014 Sauvignon (Collio)
651,"Subtle notes of clean, fresh lemon zest promise pleasure, the palate reveals a far riper aspect of fresh red apple and baked apples. The dry palate remains zingy and clean and provides ample textured freshness. The effect is that of fresh apple sorbet.",Kuentz-Bas 2014 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
652,"Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years.",Plantagenet 2014 Riesling (Great Southern)
653,"Reserved red-cherry fruit aromas gain complexity with fog-soaked sagebrush, dried purple flowers and an earthy mushroom character on the nose. Roasted shiitake, marjoram, crushed Brazil nuts and a hint of cardamom play on the dark, spicy, earthy palate, laid across a bed of cranberry fruit.",Scratch 2013 Grenache (Arroyo Seco)
654,"Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity.

Wonderfully fruity and pure.",Sipp Mack 2014 Rosacker Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
655,"This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around.

656,"This cuvée is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb.

657,"The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry.

The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022.",Fable Mountain 2011 Night Sky Red (Coastal Region)
658,"This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh.",Vine Cliff 2013 Chardonnay (Los Carneros)

It's truly a standout wine at this price.",Woodinville Wine Cellars 2012 Little Bear Creek Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
699,"This classic, iconic Pinotage opens with dense aromas of pressed purple violets, forest berries, raspberry sauce and fudge brownie.

The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom.",Failla 2013 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
713,"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side. Black fruit and licorice give it a burly character at first.

726,"A rose pink colored wine that is dry and with ripe fruit. Its acidity contrasts with the warm red-berry fruit and the edge of tannin. There is a peppery, crisp aftertaste.",Quinta de Paços 2015 Casa de Paços Rosé (Vinho Verde)

910,"Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent.",Antucura 2011 Grand Vin Red (Vista Flores)
911,"Juicy dark plum, cherry and boysenberry are upfront on the nose, with additional seductive hints of purple violet and vanilla.

913,"Amber in color, this wine has aromas of peach jam and orange blossom. Flavors are a mélange of mellow fruit and savory notes, in particular apricot, lemon curd, quince and bitter almond. Despite strong tannins, there are moments of brightness across the entire palate that linger into the finish.",Gotsa Family Wines 2014 Asureti Valley Chinuri

925,"An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol.",Terre Rouge 2013 Vin Doux Naturel Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
926,"This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes.",Antonio Mas 2011 Roll Fermentor Malbec (Tupungato)

932,"The wood flavors are still prominent in this spicy wine. Heavily influenced by rich Merlot, the wine is lightly structured and more about juicy red fruits.

936,"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.",Chehalem 2013 Ian's Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)

938,"Earthy, cool aromas of wet cement, raisin and raspberry are a bit flat. This feels drawing and tannic, with flavors of tomato, red plum, currant and raspberry. A full-size finish is comfortable but not very complex.",Covila 2013 II Crianza  (Rioja)

946,"Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah are blended within this wine, given 17 months in new French oak plus once and twice-used barrels.

It tastes as if it was made for aging, so wait and drink after 2019.",Yorkville Cellars 2013 Rennie Vineyard Organic Grapes Petit Verdot (Yorkville Highlands)
952,"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.",Agustí Torelló Mata 2015 XIC Xarel-lo (Penedès)

Drink from 2018.",Château Cap Saint-Martin 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux

965,"Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting.",Vinosia 2006 Vecchie Vigne  (Primitivo di Manduria)
966,"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased.

969,"Good introductory Carmenère. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate, with red fruit, bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much.",Morandé 2008 Pionero Carmenère (Maipo Valley)

975,"Fabio Sireci is behind some of Sicily's best Nero d'Avola and has more recently decided to flex his winemaker muscle on Pinot Noir.

985,"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.",Pascual Toso 2007 Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
986,"This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste.",Quinta de la Rosa 2004 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)

989,"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors.

A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Mauro 2005 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)

998,"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion.

1000,"Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it.

1001,"Nerello Mascalese, a grape native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna, delivers fresh berry notes that recall raspberry, blueberry and mulberry backed by toasted almond.

1005,"A full, soft Sauvignon from close to Sancerre. There is a light, yeasty character to this young wine, but the fruit is all there—fresh pink grapefruit, lime and green berries. The finish is acidic and crisp, but still mouth-filling.",Domaine Philippe Portier 2007  Quincy
1006,"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits.

1008,"Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit.

1010,"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
1011,"Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari.",Hunt Country Vineyards 2007 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes)

1015,"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot.

1018,"This wine is still young, showing spice and not yet enough fruit. It has the right weight and potential richness as well as concentration from the old vines. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2016.",Ruhlmann 2013 Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
1019,"Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel.",Spring Mountain Vineyard 2011 Elivette Red (Napa Valley)
1020,"Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.",Stanton Vineyard 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
1021,"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.",Terrazas de Los Andes 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
1022,"Made entirely with Insolia, this opens with subdued aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The bright, linear palate offers passion fruit, peach, nectarine zest and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity.",Cusumano 2013 Cubia Tenuta Ficuzza Insolia (Sicilia)
1023,"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus. Tannins are a tad bold for a relatively delicate white wine, but they are tempered by baking spice flavors that wash across the tongue and notes of tangerine on the back palate.",Dalton 2013 Alma Semillon-Viognier-Pinot Gris White (Galilee)
1024,"The Pfleck vineyard with its clay and limestone soil gives a rich style of Pinot Gris. This wine, with its intense spice and lychee flavors, is typical. It has a crisp edge but the ripe fruitiness and touch of pepper give weight and richness. Drink now.",Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2012 Pfleck Pinot Gris (Alsace)
1025,"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
1026,"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now.",Firesteed 2013 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
1027,"The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.",Folin Cellars 2012 Estate Grenache (Rogue Valley)
1028,"This lighter-bodied Mencía from Valdeorras shows exotic, minerally aromas of raspberry, blueberry and Middle Eastern spices. The palate runs crisp and fresh, but not real deep or intense. Flavors of raspberry, plum and schist finish dry and floral, with a touch of lasting oak.",Gaba do Xil 2012 Mencía (Valdeorras)
1029,"Clean, peachy aromas set up a light, minerally, citrusy body. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and lemon hold steady and double up on gooseberry on the finish. Overall, this is round, minerally and elegant, but also slightly sour and edgy.",Gorka Izagirre 2013 White (Bizkaiko Txakolina)
1030,"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature.",Grgich Hills 2012 Miljenko's Selection Chardonnay (Carneros)
1031,"Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity.

1032,"This is a soft, slightly sweet rendering of Pinot Gris, loaded with succulent pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Chill it well and sip it by the pool this summer.",Omaka Springs 2013 Pinot Gris (Marlborough)
1033,"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish.",Ventana 2013 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
1034,"With its few years of aging, this is now a ripe and broad wine rich in yellow fruits that are cut with pear juice. It has nutty overtones, and a bright, crisp aftertaste.",Vieil Armand 2010 Clos de la Tourelle Château Ollwiller Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
1035,"This juicy, delicious red features aromas of red berry, Mediterranean brush and aromatic herb. The easygoing palate doles out ripe blackberry, crushed Morello cherry, a charred note and a touch of baking spice alongside smooth, supple tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the succulent fruit.",Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2012 Aquilae Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)

1039,"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albariño. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately.",Pazo Torrado 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
1040,"Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity.",Sur de los Andes 2012 Clásico Malbec (Mendoza)
1041,"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster. The aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar and dried herbs are pleasant, but carry with them a worring dry astringency. Try drinking this over the near term, with rare beef to help ameliorate the tannin's effects.",Babich 2011 The Patriarch Premium Red (Hawke's Bay)
1042,"A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish.",Rentas de Fincas 2003 Crianza  (Rioja)
1043,"The lightest in a range of Grüner Veltliner from Hans Setzer. This is a green apple and grapefruit flavored wine, all lightness, freshness and crispness. There is a green plum skin tang to it, added to citrus.",Setzer 2007 Vesper Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
1044,"The wine boasts a pretty golden hue and segues to tones of almond skin, stone fruit, nut and cardboard. It feels smooth and rich in the mouth and has some tart citrus flavors on the close.",Tenuta Luisa 2007 Rive Alte Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli)
1045,"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.",Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
1046,"There's a saccharin or soda-like element to the nose of this Verduzzo-Friulano blend that gives the wine a cheerful, upfront personality but that overpowers the natural fruit. The wine tastes both tart and sweet and ends with butterscotch candy flavors.",I Clivi 2004 Bianco degli Arzillari White (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
1047,"This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.",Irony 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley)
1048,"Created by music industry businessman Kedar Massenburg (CEO Motown Records), the K'orus range is produced in the Languedoc. This Cabernet Sauvignon gives blackberry fruits, very juicy, lightly sweet to finish, but retaining attractive structure and acidity.",Kedar's K'orus NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc)

1050,"Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.",Little Black Dress 2006 Merlot (California)
1051,"Quite leesy and funky, with meaty, oily aromas that are a departure from normal Albariño and are indicative of the 30% Treixadura and Loureiro that beef things up. Perfectly drinkable, and with a decent mouthfeel, but still it lacks the straightforward cleanliness of the really good wines from Galicia. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co.",Marqués de Vizhoja 2007 Señor da Folla Verde White (Rías Baixas)
1052,"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.",Estancia 2007 Pinot Grigio (California)
1053,"With tobacco, molasses, spearmint and baked fruit aromas, this finds itself squarely in the old school forum. The palate shows straight-ahead red fruit with light herbal and pepper accents. Snappy and a bit thin, but it offers all the basics.",Finca La Emperatriz 2000 Reserva  (Rioja)
1054,"Grassy and tonic with background shadings of white flower and stone fruit, this Ribolla Gialla offers aromas of white peach, kiwi and subtle hints of exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and lean in the mouth.",Vinai dell'Abbate 2006 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)

1057,"A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer.",Botalcura 2006 El Delirio Reserve Syrah-Malbec Red (Central Valley)
1058,"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.",Bridgeway 2004 Syrah (Central Coast)
1059,"La Piazza is a line of wine from Sicily's Calatrasi winery that uses fruit from various parts of Italy.

1060,"As in nearby Sauternes, 2005 produced some exceptionally rich botrytised wine in Monbazillac. This example from one of the leading Bergerac producers certainly shows plenty of richness, but it seems rather too sugary, showing toffee flavors and fatness. The acidity is missing.",Château Bélingard 2005  Monbazillac
1061,"For those with a classical bent, Clos Teddi is named after Thetis, sea goddess and mother of Achilles. This rosé, appropriately, summons up lunch by the ocean, with its crisp, fresh, dry strawberry and pink grapefruit flavors, just touched by caramel.",Clos Teddi 2007 Rosé Red (Patrimonio)

1064,"This is a ripe, slightly jammy blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot with tones of cooked spice and blackberry pie.

You'll feel some grit on the palate and more fruit flavors on the close.",Principe di Corleone 2004 Evoè Red (Sicilia)
1065,"Ripe and fruity, this is already delicious, but that doesn't detract from the firm tannins and density of a wine that will age well. It has all the elements, with the fruit, solid tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2025.",Sandeman 2015 Quinta do Seixo Vintage  (Port)
1066,"Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin.

1068,"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit.

Drink now through the mid-2020s.",Trisaetum 2014 Family Reserve MMXIV Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
1069,"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine.

It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest.",Bergström 2015 Bergström Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)

1071,"This wine's enticing rose, blue flower, menthol and herb scents come together in the glass.

Drink 2023–2035.",Mauro Veglio 2013 Castelletto  (Barolo)
1072,"This is a major Douro wine from the Poças family-owned Port and wine producer. Dusty tannins already give it class as well as richness.

1076,"From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy.

Drink from 2019.",Alphonse Mellot 2014 En Grands Champs  (Sancerre)
1077,"This savory, firmly structured, full-bodied red opens with subtle dark berry, rose petal, pipe tobacco and crushed herb aromas.

1112,"Dense almost to the point of chewiness, this is a concentrated blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Earthy, plummy notes pick up hints of dark chocolate and licorice before ending rich and velvety.",Château d'Or et de Gueules 2010 Les Cimels Red (Costières de Nîmes)
1113,"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)
1114,"Opening with aromas of underbrush, perfumed berries and crushed violets, this balanced Rosso displays its pedigree. The savory palate delivers dense wild cherry layered with orange peel, white pepper, mocha and cake spices alongside supple tannins. Energizing minerality signals the close. Enjoy now–2017.",Citille di Sopra 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
1115,"This 2008 holdover shows a mix of jammy, composed berry aromas as well as staunch notes of dried cheese and leather. The palate is firm at first, then more loamy and layered. On the flavor profile, baked berry blends with brine and cardamom, while on the finish this ready-to-drink RDD delivers licorice and earthy baked notes.",Condado de Oriza 2008 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
1116,"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish.",Cookies & Cream 2010 Merlot (California)
1117,"Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life. Decent now, but better to drink 2018–2022.",Daou 2012 Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
1118,"Ripe black plum, forest floor, mint and spice notes lead the nose on this savory, medium-bodied red. The succulent, straightforward palate doles out fleshy black cherry and crushed raspberry accented with black pepper and clove alongside round tannins. Drink through 2015.",Dei 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano
1119,"A blend of white Bordeaux and local Gers grapes, this is a smooth, medium sweet wine. With three years of aging, it has become mature, rich in smoky flavors as well as dried apricot and bitter oranges. Acidity keeps everything in line. It's ready to drink.",Domaine de Gensac 2011 Quadrille White (Gers)
1120,"Chardonay and Pinot Noir are both present in this apple and pear flavored wine. A lively mousse brings out the fruit and acidity, giving a tangy, bright wine that's ready to drink now.",Domaine Rolet Père et Fils 2008 Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Jura)
1121,"This wine came out of the disaster of shriveled Duras grapes after an especially hot period. Rather than discarding them, Domaine Rotier made a wine. Wood aged, it has many of the characters of a late harvest with its rich, sweet, lightly tannic flavors and sufficient acidity to balance. A surprising success.",Domaine Rotier NV Noces de Feu Duras (Vin de Liqueur)
1122,"While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now.",Three Brothers 2014 Zero Degree Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake)
1123,"Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there.",Wilridge 2014 Dessert Wine Estate Wilridge Vineyard Pinot Gris (Naches Heights)
1124,"This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto Cão (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souzão. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip.",Wilridge 2014 Vintage Estate Dessert Wine Wilridge Vineyard Red (Naches Heights)
1125,"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.",Belden Barns 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain)
1126,"Based in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always.",Château du Retout 2013  Haut-Médoc
1127,The producer has probably used too much wood for the fruit and density of this wine. The toastiness does not allow any fruit to show through.,Château la Gravette Lacombe 2013  Médoc
1128,"This wine is lean with acidity playing over the red-currant fruits, leaving a character that's light and tight. While the wine will soften it's not likely to show any more weight or richness.",Château Méric 2013  Médoc
1129,"Prickly aromas of juniper and cherry are sharp and lean towards green. This Malbec feels tight and lean, while plum and herbal aromas qualify as basic. A light, racy finish pinches and tastes generic.",Apaltagua 2014 Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley)
1130,"This is a challenging mix of substantially puckering tannins and herbaceous notes, dotted in black peppercorns. The fruit is elusive.",In Re 2011 You be the judge! Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1131,"Despite some ripe, honeyed aromas, this is light in body and quite lean on the palate. Underripe pineapple flavors show a tart, herbal edge on the finish.",Chasing Venus 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
1132,"This soft, jammy and fruity wine is ready to drink, with black-currant flavors that are ripe and rounded. Only the lightest tannins gives any structure to this wine that is immediately accessible.",Château les Joyeuses 2014  Bordeaux
1133,Too enthusiastic use of wood has left this wine bereft of fruit and unbalanced.,Château Monfort Bellevue 2012  Médoc
1134,"This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste. Through 2016, it will soften a little, although always missing the fruit. The blend is 55% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Ssauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.",Château Vrai Caillou 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur
1135,"Prickly aromas of nettle are simple as well as diluted. This feels basic and fresh, while green, citrusy flavors end with pithy notes and an oily feel.",Concha y Toro 2015 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Sauvignon Blanc (Chile)
1136,"This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh.",Experience 2012 Red (Napa Valley)
1137,"This easygoing, simple red offers hints of dark berry flavors while a note of dark spice fleetingly appears in the background. It's uber-informal and rather diluted with a short but clean finish.",Cantine Grasso 2014 Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
1138,"This informal rosato offers delicate aromas and flavors of wild red berry and blood orange. It's rather lean and diluted, with bracing acidity.",Grifalco 2014 Frà Rosato (Basilicata)
1139,An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.,Madrigal 2012 Las Viñas del Señor Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1140,"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate.",Millbrook 2013 Proprietor's Special Reserve Chardonnay (Hudson River Region)
1141,"Aromas of corn and melon are waxy and oily. This feels pinched and juicy, but not crisp or minerally. Stalky flavors of corn, citrus and apple lean towards bitter, as does the finish.",Santa Rita 2014 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley)

1143,"After 34 months in previously used French barrels, this wine has a brownish rim. It smells like pepper, clove and cinnamon and tastes like dried fruit. Considerable tannins contribute to an astringent mouthfeel.",Spicy Vines 2011 Sacrlet's Flirtation Zinfandel (Mendocino)
1144,"This Meritage is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tasting quite ripe, it has a burnt sage and cedar undertone. Tannins hit on the back of the palate with power and not much finesse.",Kirkland Signature 2012 Meritage (Napa Valley)
1145,"This fresh wine has plenty of acidity as well as some firm tannins. It is still young, waiting to fill out with riper fruit flavors. The aftertaste just repeats the acidity.",Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2014 La Tour du Gouverneur  (Bordeaux)

1147,"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together.",Barnard Griffin 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
1148,"This lean red initially opens with a sulfur aroma that burns off to reveal steeped prune, dried violet and a hint of resin. The diluted, fleeting palate offers hints of black cherry and walnut skin.",Cantine Grasso 2013 Caporosso Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
1149,"Lean and tannic, this wine has chocolate and bitter coffee flavors from over-extraction. The fruit is suppressed at this stage, with a bitter aftertaste.",Château les Lattes 2013  Médoc
1150,"Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green. This feels awkward and jammy, with little to no structural integrity. Flavors of prune, raisin and oak finish soft and loamy.",Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Carmenère (Central Valley)
1151,"Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera. Whiffs of dried fruit and caramel are enticing, but the palate juxtaposes craggy acidity with mouthfeel that's dampening and flat.",Ports of New York NV Meleau White Specialty Wine White (New York)
1152,"This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish.",Whitman Cellars 2004 Narcissa Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
1153,"The focus of this full, rounded, soft Pinot Blanc is on the pear flavors. The mineral texture is about easy-drinking freshness allied to attractive acidity.",Winkler-Hermaden 2007 Steierische Klassik Weissburgunder (Südoststeiermark)
1154,"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent. Still, the flavors of mint, pepper and meat layered over plum and raspberry fruit offer a lot to like, and the acids may actually make this wine more versatile with food than many more unctuous Shiraz.",Fire Block 2004 Old Vine Shiraz (Clare Valley)
1155,"The White Fox is a refreshing, crisp white that offers a balance of acidity, spice and creamy pear flavors. There's body and the wine has weight without being heavy, its lemon acidity keeping it aloft.",Palivou 2006 White Fox Roditis (Corinth)
1156,"Manfred Felsner obviously enjoys the spicy character of Grüner Veltliner, because, like all his wines from this varietal, this has spice in spades. But it also has good fresh acidity, which emphasizes the green fruit character of the wine, bringing out the crispness of the year. Screwcap.",Felsner 2007 Rohrendorfer Leithen Alte Reben Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
1157,"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish.",Gemella 2005 L'Anima Petite Sirah (Mendocino)
1158,"A big, ripe wine, full of berry fruits and rhubarb, edged with tannins, spice and red plum skins. It has a juicy, rich quality, enhanced by acidity, and rounded with vanilla. Keep for a year. Screwcap.",Gunter Triebaumer 2006 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)

1161,"There's a distinctly mineral, almost ashen quality to this wine that recalls talcum powder and schoolroom chalkboard. The wine is linear and defined and has very pungent, almost sharp, effervescence with drying minerals on the close and will keep the palate polished and clean.",Bisol NV Desiderio Jeio Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto)
1162,"This Prosecco Extra Dry has a subtle, easy approach with measured fruit intensity but recognizable sweetness in the form of silky honey and melon. It offers a good measure of cleaning effervescence and chewy fruit to keep it going.",Carmina NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano)

1166,"With its peppery spices and briary, brambly notes of ripe wild berries, this wine tastes more like Zinfandel than Merlot. It's not true to the variety, but it is a solid red wine, dry and full-bodied.",Wellington 2004 Estate Merlot (Sonoma Valley)
1167,"Here is a very clean and pristine Prosecco Brut with measured but distinct notes of white peach, acacia flower and chopped kiwi. The wine tastes creamy and slightly sweet with chewy peach flavors. It makes a perfect aperitif wine.",Zonin NV Special Cuvée Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto)

1170,"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",Trapiche 2007 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza)
1171,"Despite weighing in at 12% alcohol, this seems light in body and sweet in style, with honeyed pineapple aromas and flavors of apple skin and lime. Finishes stridently, with a dusty texture.",Louis Guntrum 2006 Niersteiner Bergkirche Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen)
1172,"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.",Pali 2006 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
1173,"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.",Robert Stemmler 2005 Nugent Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
1174,"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla.

With a fresh aftertaste, the wine will be just right for food.",Wines & Winemakers 2015 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Rosé (Douro)
1178,"Aromas of blackberry and briar patch expand to include violet notes. In the mouth, there's pulpy weight to the fruit and rubbery tannins for framing. Rugged but generic black-fruit flavors finish with toasty darkness and some burn.",Zolo 2014 Reserve Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Valle de Uco)

1181,"Aromas suggesting dried rose petal, woodland berry, chopped mint and kitchen spice come together on this. The tight palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose, offering sour cherry, tart cranberry and a hint of clove alongside bracing tannins that grip the finish.",Bel Colle 2013 Montersino  (Barbaresco)

1194,"Rubbery, gaseous initial aromas give way to piquant red-fruit notes. This feels lean, racy and very high in acidity.

1195,"Leathery aromas of horseradish and stewed berries lead to a rooty, syrupy palate. Flavors of cola, chocolate and raisin are creamy as a whole. This tastes ripe on the finish, with raisin and oxidized notes. This Merlot-Cabernet-Malbec blend has its strong points but comes across baked and raisiny.",Antucura 2011 Calcura Red (Vista Flores)
1196,"Though aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with scents and flavor hints of toast and butter. The fruit is clean and generic, like a fresh apple, but the mouthfeel lacks life and fades into a flat finish. Drink up.",Aubichon Cellars 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)

Finishes on a lingering white peach note.",Blue Fish 2015 Original Riesling (Pfalz)

1207,"Truffle, underbrush, new leather and chopped herb aromas slowly emerge in the glass.

1208,"Old vines, many up to 80-years-old, supply the grapes that were fermented in traditional granite lagars for a ripe jammy character in this powerful wine. It has solid tannins and great acidity, both of which will allow the wine to age. Drink this impressive wine from 2020.",Quinta da Foz 2016 Reserva Red (Douro)

A creamy viscosity and wonderful layers of butter, apple, vanilla and ginger make for a delicious palate.",Roederer Estate NV Estate Bottled Brut Sparkling (Anderson Valley)

1212,"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality.

1213,"Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend.

1269,"Opens with peachy, citric and saline aromas. Feels moderately fresh, but seems as though it's starting to mature as it's fleshy and pithy.

1348,"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes. It's a heavy, honey-soaked style, perhaps due to grapes that were affected by botrytis.

1382,"A good but awkward attempt at a bigger, more saturated, more serious wine. The nose tells you that it's ripe, but there's some reduction in there too.

It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of blackberry, currant, cola, new oak and spice flavors. It's so good now, you may not want to cellar it, but try. It will begin to approach its peak after 2017.",Rocca 2010 Collinetta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
1429,"The 85% of Cabernet Sauvignon is upfront, with Syrah providing an accent. It's tightly wound, with notes of dusty cherry, sautéed herbs and spices, and tart cranberries supported by chewy, firm tannins that need time in the cellar to come into their own. Best after 2017.",Buty 2010 Columbia Rediviva Phinny Hill Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
1430,"Caldwell managed to wrest plenty of blackberry and cherry fruit into this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, even though the vintage was a tough one. The wine, aged in 80% new French oak, is elaborate and opulent, but the tannins are strong, giving the palate a lockdown astringency. It should age well though and your window of drinking begins in 2019.",Caldwell 2011 Silver Red (Napa Valley)
1431,"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines.",Charles Smith 2012 Stoneridge Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))

1434,"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, this is a dense and brooding wine, with dark notes of cassis, licorice, black plum, date and cigar-box spice on the nose and in the mouth. The palate is firmly structured, with medium tannins and balanced alcohol that lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture. Glimmers of charred oak and toasted spice linger long on the finish. Delicious now, but should develop more layer and nuance with time; drink through 2018.",Kanonkop 2008 Paul Sauer Red (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)
1435,"The 2010 Bello Rosso sticks to the 50-50 Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon formula, with a full, round, ripe and balanced palate.

1438,"A hint of mossy undergrowth leads on the nose, while lovely notes of white-pepper dusted green and yellow pear unfold on the soft, rounded palate.

1440,"Sourced from a vineyard high up in the Mayacamas, on the Sonoma County side, this wine is intense with mountain grown fruit. The palate is full of ripe black currants, mocha and plenty of toasty oak. The tannins, while soft and pliant, are penetrating. All indications are of a wine that wants time in the cellar.

1442,"Brooding flavors of dark cherry and pure cocoa initially play on the palate, but it slowly opens up to reveal a deceptive lightness. The body is sleek yet concentrated, with super-soft tannins.

1443,"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens.

1445,Bouscassé is the home of Alain Brumont who also owns Château Montus in Madiran. This powerful wine with its blend of Tannat with the two Cabernets (Franc and Sauvignon) is dense and packed with firm tannins.

With black plum fruit, dense tannins and intense acidity, it's built for longterm aging. Drink from 2021.",Alves de Sousa 2013 Abandonado Red (Douro)
1448,"2014 proves another banner year for this delightful blend of Sémillon from Monte Rosso Vineyard, Muscadelle from Pagani Ranch and Palomino and Muscadelle from Saitone Ranch. High-toned in tart, refreshing acidity, it offers hints of vanilla biscuit with its lime, apple and melon flavors, lingering in memory for days.",Carlisle 2014 The Derivative White (Sonoma County)
1449,"Purists will no doubt object to this wine's fine patina of sophisticated, cedary oak, but there's plenty of high-quality fruit to back it up. Incorporating unusual proportions of 44% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 23% Syrah, the fruit is ripe and lush, velvety-supple and medium to full in weight, without any sense of heaviness.

Impressive and full bodied, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2024.",David Duband 2014 Les Sentiers Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny)
1452,"Underbrush, truffle, crushed herb and ripe black-skinned fruit aromas slowly take shape along with a waft of new leather. The bold palate shows mature black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco framed in big velvety tannins. This is already tempting but will be even better in a few years.

1455,"The winery's characteristic dense style is immediately apparent in this blend of 54% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 16% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah.

Pencil shavings, black pepper and cigar accents are present throughout.",Freemark Abbey 2013 Cabernet Bosché Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
1457,"Initial whiffs of smoke and struck flint fade into pretty pineapple and blossom on the nose of this full-bodied, dry Riesling. Mango and tangerine flavors are riper and heftier on the palate than in many of the Mosel's 2015 Grosses Gewächs wines, neatly balanced by racy acidity and a backbone of cool steel. It's delicious already, but likely to evolve well through the 2020s at least.",Fritz Haag 2015 Brauneberg Juffer Sonnenuhr Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel)
1458,"Named after the 15th century owner of this estate, the wine comes from a selection of the best parcels.

1466,"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity.",Pine Ridge 2013 Fortis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape.",Stone The Crows 2014 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
1470,"Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check.",Tolosa 2015 Hollister Edna Ranch Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
1471,"Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. On the chewy palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth to dried cherry and raspberry. Velvety tannins give it just enough tension and texture. Drink 2018–2024.",Villa Poggio Salvi 2011 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)

Drink now through 2033.",Volker Eisele Family Estate 2013 Sievers Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1473,"There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery. But as it knits together and the fruit rises, you'll see that there's a compact, serious wine laying in wait. Flavors of blackberry, licorice and herbs are authentic and powerful. Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.",TerraNoble 2006 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
1474,"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino is a simple, fruit-forward wine with loads of red cherry, blueberry, cedar wood and exotic spice. It has a gritty, spicy mouthfeel and big, powerful tannins.",Terre de Trinci 2003 Riserva  (Montefalco Rosso)
1475,"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",Mosolo Gleni 2006 Pinot Grigio Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
1476,"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",Arbor Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
1477,"A solid wine with a good mix of herbal, cola and red-fruit aromas. It deals spanking red fruit flavors and a sprinkle of vanilla and chocolate on the racy finish. For a short, fresh and clean wine, Aresti's Cab makes the grade.",Aresti 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rio Claro)
1478,"This 60-40 blend features gentle aromas of vanilla and cassis in a medium-bodied, creamy-smooth format. It's not powerful or complex, but offers pure cassis and vanilla flavors tinged with chocolate on the finish. Good value.",Wolf Blass 2005 Yellow Label Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
1479,"Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.",Chilensis 2006 Reserva Syrah (Maule Valley)
1480,"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc.",Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2007 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
1481,"With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink.",Fetzer 2006 Valley Oaks Riesling (California)
1482,"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",Finca Sophenia 2006 Altosur Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato)
1483,"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.",Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Fournier  (Menetou-Salon)
1484,"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish.",Barker's Marque 2007 Arona Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
1485,"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",Beringer 2004 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
1486,"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless.",Bock 2000 Cuvée Barrique Red (Villány)
1487,"Shows a beautiful Pinotesque mouthfeel, all silk and satin, with that elegant Carneros acidity. But the flavors could be more concentrated. The cherries, cola and pomegranates feel a little watered down.",Carneros Creek 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
1488,"This is a bold and powerful wine with distinctive green notes that recall dried grass, black pepper and spice. It also has bitter chocolate, cardamom and cumin and its tannins are so strong, they literally leave your palate parched and dry.",Casale Triocco 2003  Sagrantino di Montefalco
1489,"Here's a delicate, feminine Sangiovese with a thin consistency and mature aromas of forest berry, raspberry, black olive and spice. It's a bit thorny in places with sour notes on the finish but it would pair well with pasta or pizza.",Castello di Monastero 2004 Sangiovese (Toscana)
1490,"Offers herb, cranberry and cherry aromas upfront, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's cedary and herbal, but also shows some chunky cherry fruit. Finishes on oaky notes of coffee and chocolate.",Konrad 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
1491,"Here's a lean, almost colorless, citrus-driven Grigio from sunny Umbria that has a bit of candy and cola on its sweet, fragrant nose. There are peppermint renderings and dried hay in the background. It's watery and lean in the mouth and would pair with appetizers or simple vegetable dishes.",Lungarotti 2006 Pinot Grigio Pinot Grigio (Umbria)
1492,"A soft, easy-to-drink Pinot Noir—even for Marlborough. Tannins are developed and supple, while the flavors lean toward caramel, cherry and sandalwood. Drink now.",Mana 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
1493,"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.",Michel Torino 2007 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley)
1494,"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't have the complexity for aging, so drink now.",Robert Hall 2005 Vintage Port Port (Paso Robles)
1495,"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, this tannic, dry wine has flavors of cherries, vanilla and smoky oak. It may develop some additional complexities over time.",Rubissow 2004 Trompettes Red (Mount Veeder)
1496,"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.",Santa Julia 2007 Organica Chardonnay (Mendoza)
1497,"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.",Santa Julia 2007 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza)
1498,"This Pinot Grigio is a bit more fragrant and floral in essence with aromas of stone fruit and peach blossom. It has a fresh, almost piquant edge but it also has that characteristic watery mouthfeel you'll likely encounter with this variety.",Ronco Blanchis 2006 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
1499,"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.",San Pedro 2006 Castillo de Molina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley)
1500,"Among the greatest expressions of Fiano, Cometa is a full and generous effort, with deep layers of passion fruit and stone fruit, plus touches of vanilla, honey and light spice. The concentration and freshness is wonderful, and the wine would pair well with steamed lobsters or buttery crab legs.",Planeta 2011 Cometa Fiano (Sicilia)
1501,"Lush and opulent, this shows complex flavors of cherry compote, raspberry jam, date and exotic spice. Thoroughly dry on the finish, this drinks well right now. It offers a delicacy that's sometimes missing in Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs. From Hess Collection.",Sequana 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
1502,"Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish.

1505,"Made using fruit from one of the top Kamptal vineyards, this perfumed wine has great texture, with tight acidity and notes of green plum skin and lemon zest.

1512,"Made using fruit that was sourced from vines planted in 1939, this wine shows the great concentration low yields and old vines can give.

1515,"Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring. The wine is rich with a sweet blackberry flavor, with lots of new French oak. The tannins are hard, reminiscent of an older era of Napa Cabernet. Give it 5–6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened.",Charles Krug 2009 Vintage Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

1518,"A powerful, wood-aged wine, this shows weighty black fruit and a toasty character. It is concentrated and solid, yet it has a soft and rich side as well.  The tarry, tannic character needs at least four years to soften.",Château de Gaudou 2010 Renaissance Malbec (Cahors)
1519,"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant.

1521,"Aromas of lead pencil, cassis, violet petal and smoky chocolate are complex and attractive. The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee.

This will please fans of California and Bordeaux wines.",Steven Kent 2009 The Premier Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)

Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.",Quilceda Creek 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
1557,"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",Williams Selyem 2009 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

1560,"A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis.

Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",JCB 2009 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

1567,"A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists.

1568,"A ripe year like 2009 is kind to the Cabernet Sauvignon of Château Figeac.

1572,"Just across the road from Pétrus, la Fleur-Pétrus shares some of the same intensity. There is great fruit here, rounded and powerful with the ripest character. It is open, generous, ready to drink. The tannins lead into the purest acidity, letting the fruit sing.",Château la Fleur-Pétrus 2009  Pomerol

1574,"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.",Groth 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
1575,"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging.

1577,"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.",Williams Selyem 2009 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
1578,"Minty new wood aromas on a wine that shows both great tannins and sweet wood. The fruit is still to show, but promises fresh plum flavors that will be delicious and juicy. This is a ripe, concentrated wine.",Château Beau-Séjour Bécot 2009  Saint-Émilion
1579,"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015.",Williams Selyem 2009 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)

The details pile on—a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion.",Doyenne 2008 Grand Ciel Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
1584,"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
1585,"A blend of three vineyards, all estate, this is a sublime, viscous and somewhat briny wine that exhibits some oak on the nose.

1589,"This wine enjoys the fruitiness of the vintage with its black-currant flavors and light tannic structure. The blend is 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.

1593,"Herbal and fruity at this young stage, this wine is bright with acidity, citrus fruits and a tangy texture.

1594,"Bright and fruity, this is classic white Bordeaux with its citrus and lively acidity as well as a crisp texture. It has weight and shows some potential to fill out, so drink from 2017.

1595,This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017.

1608,"Vanilla, coconut and toast aromas are vibrant and out-front, followed by tropical fruit. This wine is full bodied with a viscous, almost oily feel that persists through the finish. It offers some good things, but the variety gets lost in the style.",Browne Family Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))

1611,"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit.

1625,"Popping with aromas of lychee, rose, geranium and violet this wine is quite perfumed. There are also citrus notes of lime zest and lemon curd.

1627,Intense yeasty aromas lean a bit nutty with a suggestion of citrus. Aggressively frothy bubbles give way to cashews and bread dough showing hints of lemon. Grapefruit pith and peanut skin bring a slightly bitter note to the finish.,Gruet NV Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (America)

1658,"This is a crisp and fruity wine that's perfumed and full of citrus and green fruits. It has a lively character that is filled out with the ripe fruitiness of the vintage.

1659,"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit.

1660,"The Claret benefits from an additional year of bottle age, integrating the components (60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cab Franc and Malbec).

1670,This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.,Château Pindefleurs 2013  Saint-Émilion
1671,"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.",Cliff Creek 2012 Sams Valley Vineyard Merlot (Southern Oregon)
1672,"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony.",Quady North 2007 Flagship Syrah (Applegate Valley)
1673,"A huge, ripe, opulent wine, rich in orange, butter, peach, honey and spice flavors. Shows great depth and power, yet finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. Should develop bottle complexities over the next six years. Blended with 15% Roussanne.",Qupé 2010 Marsanne (Santa Ynez Valley)
1674,"Not a big, overwhelming blockbuster, this harmonious blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc features ripe citrus and pineapple flavors, with a hint of melon thrown in for good measure.

1679,"Another Livermore Valley producer to watch, Cuda Ridge has fashioned a varietally textbook Cab Franc here, with an intensely woody, herbal nose.

1680,"Opens with rooty, baked aromas before finding its legs and plenty of ripe, attractive berry fruit.

1681,"Bordeaux grapes mix with Zweigelt in this full-bodied, serious wine. It has initial severe tannins, followed by ripe currant and blackberry fruit. The wood aging gives good spice character. Well worth aging for 3–4 years.",Dürnberg 2007 Impetus Select Red (Niederösterreich)
1682,"Il Veltro is a newish brand of Brunello from Montalcino that opens with bright berry nuances and background notes of spice, cola, tobacco and leather. The mouthfeel is rich and firm, enduring but not too heavy or overdone.",Il Veltro 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
1683,"Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years.",Lange 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
1684,"Complex, mineral wine, crisp but also very, very textured. Flavors of peach and red apples work with pink grapefruit to give the fruit character, while there is also a more serious complexity of green herbs. The finish is soft, still mineral. Screwcap.",Markus Huber 2010 Grüner Veltliner (Traisental)
1685,"Rosemary-marinated steak, roast pork roll stuffed with prunes or dark chicken or turkey meat would make perfect paring partners to this red blend from southern Tuscany. Aromas of spice, mature cherry and leather are soft and penetrating.",Massi di Mandorlaia 2007 Colpetroso  (Maremma)
1686,"Fragrant with a mix of sweet grass and dusty blossom, this pleasant Sauvignon Blanc makes you wonder why the grape is so rare in Oregon.

1688,"As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.",Piña 2007 Mimbre Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1689,"Lots of tannins and acidity on this dry Grenache, but it's so rich and sweet in cherries, you can drink it now. Somehow manages to be fun and serious at the same time. A real success for this finicky variety in California.",Qupé 2009 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley)

1695,"Solid and smooth from the beginning, with cola, pastry and blackberry aromas. The palate is fresh, full and healthy, with cola, black pepper and a ton of berry push. Toasty and roasted on the finish, where coffee comes into play. Right on the spot for value-priced Malbec.",Finca Vides 2009 Torcidas Malbec (Mendoza)
1696,"The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose. Yet more harmonious tones of chocolate, coffee and spice kick in at the rear to add dimension.",Petra 2003 Quercegobbe Merlot (Toscana)
1697,"While oak can commonly overwhelm Chardonnay, this is a perfect example of an appropriate balance. Toasted notes of almond and peach pit intertwine with red apple and underripe pear; crisp acidity shines through on the finish.",Recanati 2006 Kosher Chardonnay (Galilee)
1698,"As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas.

1702,"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry.

1708,"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age.

But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",Vega de la Reina 2006 Verdejo (Rueda)
1709,"The packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet, it delivers raw strawberry, green leaf notes and loads of dried hay. It has a sharp, solid build and rigid tannins.",Villa Vignamaggio 2003 Wine Obsession I Miti Red (Toscana)
1710,"This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors. It benefits from crisp acidity, and finishes clean and off-dry.",Vinum Cellars 2006 Vista Verde Vineyard Viognier (San Benito County)
1711,"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors.

1718,"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word.

1721,"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Marqués de Cáceres 2006 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica White (Rioja)
1722,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Bodegas Campante 2006 Versatus White (Ribeiro)
1723,"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.",Brick Road 2005 Nine Gums Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)

1730,"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead.",Sixto 2012 Uncovered Chardonnay (Washington)
1731,"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit.",Syncline 2013 Subduction Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
1732,"Classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, pressed powder, violet and wild berry mingle in the glass. The vibrant palate offers layers of black cherry, dried red cherry, white pepper, truffle and savory herb alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. This is all about polish and finesse. Drink 2018–2028.",Lambardi 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
1733,"Rounded and rich, this generous, full-bodied wine comes from a single parcel in the heart of Saint-Émilion. Black fruits are structured with dense tannins and a firm tension between ripeness and dryness. The wine is powerful, finishing with pepper and spice. Drink from 2018.",Le Carré 2012  Saint-Émilion
1734,"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.",Two Vintners 2012 Some Days Are Stones Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
1735,"This blend of Les Collines (60%), Lewis (20%) and Portteus (20%) vineyards, which saw 25% new French oak, offers blueberry and huckleberry along with herb and dark chocolate accents. It's supple and soft in feel, deft but with depth to the fruit flavors.",Va Piano 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))

1737,"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time.",Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County)
1738,"Aromas of tilled earth, leafy forest floor, porcini mushroom, truffle and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate offers wild cherry layered with medicinal herb, black pepper and grilled sage supported by firm tannins. It's still young and a bit disjointed so give it time to come together. Drink after 2018.",Lisini 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
1739,"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting.",Mesa Del Sol 2009 Syrah (Arroyo Seco)
1740,"This full-bodied red manages to be concentrated and weightless at the same time. It opens with aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of espresso. The smooth, almost creamy palate delivers a black cherry core while notes of graphite, clove, ground pepper and cake spice add depth. It's impeccably balanced, with velvety tannins and just the right amount of freshness. Drink through 2017.",Ornellaia 2012 Le Serre Nuove  (Bolgheri)
1741,"This is an extremely rare beast—a single-vineyard, single-varietal (Pinot Noir), single-vintage sparkling wine. Aged sur lie for 42 months, it draws you into the glass with notes of smoke, raspberry, mineral and nutty spices. The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish.",Analemma 2010 Atavus Vineyard Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA))
1742,"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.",Bella 2012 Block 10 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
1743,"Aromas of menthol, dried flower, ripe berry, leather and savory herb lead the nose. The rich palate delivers crushed wild cherry, stewed plum, cinnamon, anise and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Despite its big, friendly structure, it also boasts finesse. Drink through 2022.",Centolani 2010 Poggiotondo  (Brunello di Montalcino)
1744,"Meaty and spicy, this wine is in an early stage of development. It has dark tannins that have an extracted, tough character. However, the weight of ripe fruit is all there, promising a rich and concentrated wine for the future. Drink from 2020.",Château Bouscaut 2012  Pessac-Léognan
1745,"New-wood spice dominates the aroma of this wine, given weight by the rich black plum fruits and concentrated acidity. With its big structure and equally big fruits, this is an impressive wine for long aging. Drink from 2022.",Château Couhins 2012  Pessac-Léognan
1746,"This wine has yeasty aromas and a light character that brings out springy acidity before the dry botrytis. It is still forming itself around the dry core, waiting to become generous and rich. Drink from 2019.",Château d'Arche 2011  Sauternes
1747,"One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure. It's not a wine for long aging with its already-fragrant acidity. It has sweet tannins, delicious fruitiness and a lengthy aftertaste. Drink from 2019.",Château Gaudin 2011  Pauillac
1748,"As is often the case with Phélan Ségur, there is an excess of wood in this wine. Sometimes it works, as here, because the big, bold fruits are powerful enough to match the toastiness. That suggests a future as a ripe, black-fruited and structured wine with room for juicy acidity. Drink from 2019.",Château Phélan-Ségur 2012  Saint-Estèphe
1749,"This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style.",Darcie Kent Vineyards 2012 De Mayo Block Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
1750,"Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now.",Univitis 2013 Château Les Vergnes  (Bordeaux)
1751,"Briny lemon-lime aromas are simplistic. This blend of Moscatel and Merseguera is foamy, while good acidity keeps it on a level plane. Ripe, sweet flavors of lychee, honeydew and mango are pure Moscato, while acidity from the Mersequera helps this along.",Volver 2014 Tarima Sparkling (Alicante)
1752,"This is a straightforward quaffer. Aromas of herbs, jasmine and stone fruit lead to sugary-sweet fruit flavors.",Washington Hills 2014 Late Harvest Riesling (Washington)
1753,"From the beginning, this crianza from a very good vintage is lacking. The nose is mulchy and cheesy, with almost no fruit character. The palate is edgy in feel, while leafy, stalky red-fruit flavors are salty and taste of vanilla and caramel.",Finca La Pica 2011 Crianza  (Rioja)
1754,Jammy fruits conflict with a firm tannic structure. This wine is not yet balanced and needs a lighter touch. Producer is Jean Paul Barre.,Château Saint-Urban 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux

1757,"Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016.",Domaine Beausejour 2014 Les Grenettes Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)

1759,"Charred, blackened aromas of mint, licorice and burnt tire overshadow the wine's black-fruit components. This feels thick and dense, with chewy weight.

1760,"While this wine has a strong tannic structure, it also offers plenty of ripe fruit. Acidity is kept in its place, giving freshness allied to warm berries. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",Producta Vignobles 2013 Mission St. Vincent  (Bordeaux)
1761,"Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling. Throughout a tasting of two samples, there are lingering tones of rubber and struck matches that blow off gradually with aeration.",Silver Thread 2014 Randolph O'Neill Vineyard Riesling (Cayuga Lake)
1762,"This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.",V. Sattui 2012 Malbec (Napa Valley)
1763,"Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now.",Ventosa 2013 Riesling (Seneca Lake)

1767,"Too much extraction has given this wine a dry character. It does have juicy red fruits underneath and these should come out as the wine ages. It is likely, though, always to be a dry wine.",Château Barreyre 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur
1768,"This firm, smoky wine with fine tannins and ripe fruit is developing well, allowing the berry fruits to come through the structure. Give this wine until late 2016.",Château Laronde Désormes 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur

1770,"From owner Jean-Pierre Palatin's vineyards at the highest elevation in this appellation, this mostly Merlot wine is soft and fruity, ripe but with little sense of structure.

The winemaker is Thomas Guibert who also handles Ferrand, Palatin's Saint-Émilion grand cru.",Château Roquevieille 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
1771,"A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous.",Cocobon 2013 Red (California)

1773,"Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme.",Doña Isadora 2012 Carmenère (Central Valley)
1774,"Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak.",Ehret 2010 Bellarina Meritage (Knights Valley)
1775,"Ripe and jammy with attractive soft fruits and acidity, this wine has crushed strawberry and light spice flavors. Drink from late 2016.

The estate manager is Fredéric Dubois and consultant is Georges Pauli.",Château de Belcier 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
1776,"This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced.

1777,"While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits. Acidity and a crisp texture give it a lift and brightness. Drink this 100% Merlot from 2016 when the tannins have softened.",Château Donjon de Bruignac 2013 Premium  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
1778,"Perfumed strawberry aromas show well. On the palate, this wine is fruity, jammy in texture with good balancing acidity. The tannins still need to soften, so drink from 2017.",Château Godard 2013  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux

1780,"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.",Helix by Reininger 2011 Stone Tree SoRhô Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
1781,"Classically crafted, it opens with a fruit-driven fragrance of bright red berries accented with whiffs of cooking spices and balsamic herbs.

Soft and delicious, this is already accessible so enjoy over the next few years.",Capanna 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
1782,"Jammy, ripe blueberry and blackberry aromas belie a crisp, tight palate, with wild berry, licorice and peppery flavors.

1786,"This is a über aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish.",Koenig Vineyards 2011 Ice Wine Riesling
1787,"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020–2022.",Krutz 2011 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
1788,"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance. Give it until 2018–2019 in the cellar to gain traction.",Loring Wine Company 2012 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
1789,"It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together.",Loring Wine Company 2012 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
1790,"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017.",Los Vencejos 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley)

1793,"This earthy wine opens with aromas of meat juices, baking spices and black fruit together with notes of leather and balsam.

1795,"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018.",Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
1796,"This is pure Mourvèdre from three excellent Red Mountain sites: Heart of the Hill, Ciel du Cheval and Grand Rêve vineyards. Tart, stony raspberry fruit carries a hint of cured meat and straw. The wine displays excellent length and a delicious purity.",Syncline 2011 Mourvèdre (Red Mountain)
1797,"Andrea Cortonese makes ripe, structured Brunellos and this is an impressive effort from the variable 2008 vintage. It opens with aromas reminiscent of black plum, chocolate, vanilla and leather. These carry over to the palate along with toasted notes, spice and espresso. The fruit is supported by assertive tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2015–2023.",Uccelliera 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
1798,"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.",Villadoria 2004 Riserva  (Barolo)
1799,"Smooth and rich while remaining structured, this wine performs the role of second wine very well. The tannins are already rounded and the black currant fruit remains fresh. It should be ready to drink in 2016.",Château Cos d'Estournel 2011 Les Pagodes de Cos  (Saint-Estèphe)
1800,"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element.

1801,"The local grape Castelão is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in this soft, spicy and fruity wine. Red fruits and balanced acidity are given a shove by a lightly tannic structure. The wine is ready to drink.",Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Terra de Lobos Tinto Red (Tejo)
1802,"It seems perverse to plant Gewürztraminer in the Douro and this wine is as much a curiosity as it is attractively perfumed. Showing all the hallmarks of the grape, the palate carries flavors of lychee and rosewater, although it all seems muted. The acidity does give a final lift.",Real Companhia Velha 2014 Gewurztraminer (Duriense)

1805,"Coming in a sparkly package befitting its name, this boxed wine shows honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose. On the palate, green apple flesh and pink apple skins prove tart and ripe at the same time, though without tons of body or finish. It's a solid deal though!",Jewelry Box 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
1806,"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello.",Juvé y Camps 2013 Essential Xarel-lo (Cava)
1807,"Lanson suggests adding fruit to this wine or using it as the base for cocktails. It is off dry, ripe and fruity in itself. A touch of toast suggests this bottling is not young. The wine confuses between crisp acidity and a soft, neutral texture. It will probably be best when it is part of a mixed drink.",Lanson NV White Label Sec  (Champagne)
1808,"Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice.",Magnolia Court 2013 Chardonnay (Central Coast)

1810,"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.",Mantel Blanco 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
1811,"Savory aromas and flavors combine with a soft texture in this full-bodied wine. It smells smoky and roasted, tastes like pomegranate and cherry juice and has a streak of acidity but not much tannin.",Red Rock 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (California)

1818,"This wine is tight, fresh with crisp red currant and red-cherry flavors. It is as bright as a button, fruity with layers of acidity that bring out a perfumed character at the end. The Colonge family has been growing grapes in Beaujolais since 1789.",Domaine André Colonge 2014  Beaujolais
1819,"Fresh and fruity, this is a ripe, cherry-flavored wine (hence the name Griottes, a type of cherry). It is light with a straight line of acidity that cuts through the attractive fruitiness. Drink immediately.",Domaine du Vissoux 2014 Les Griottes Rosé (Beaujolais Rosé)
1820,"Banana aromas don't intrude too strongly into the fruity palate of this wine that has a crisp character. Tart red-berry fruits and and bright acidity give the wine a fresh, totally fruity appeal with only a hint of tannin. Drink now.",Domaine Pral 2014 Les Pays de Pierres Dorées  (Beaujolais)

1823,"Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted. It needs plenty of time, so drink from late 2016.",Georges Duboeuf 2014  Chiroubles
1824,"This structured wine has a tight, tannic, dry character. It is slow to develop, leaving the black cherry fruits still masked by the forward dryness. Drink from 2016.",Georges Duboeuf 2014 Domaine du Paradis  (Saint-Amour)

1827,"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",Adegas Moure 2013 Tradición Joven Red (Ribeira Sacra)
1828,"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate.

1829,This wine offers appealing aromatics of caramel apple before delving into viscous territory on the palate. Flavors fall somewhat flat and the finish is muddled.,Cairdean Estate 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
1830,"The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosé of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet.",Cardwell Hill 2014 Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
1831,"Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most.",Viluko 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
1832,"Vanilla and maple aromas lead to overtly fruity red cherry flavors with a touch of sweetness and a soft texture. It's pleasant to drink for those looking for a soft touch, with very mild acidity and no tannin to speak of.",Alias 2013 Secret Agent Red (California)
1833,"This Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil. The palate seems caught between heavy and racy, while flavors of candied white fruits, apple and pear come with residual sugar and a sketchy foundation.",Bodegas Paniza 2013 Agostón Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena)
1834,"Smooth but tangy, this offers good fresh citrus aromas and flavors, a softer-than-usual texture but a bright, clean character that stays fresh on the finish.",Bota Box 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
1835,"Chunky, raisiny lead aromas come with more than enough vanilla, mocha and creamy oak backing. This has a lazy, baked, tannic feel and heavy flavors of candied blackberry and creamy oak. It smells and tastes forced.",Viña Arnáiz 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
1836,"Grilled peach and almond notes show on the nose, while the palate is tighter in profile, offering apple pomace and lemon rind.",Good Harbor 2011 Dry Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula)
1837,"Light and fruity, this is an attractive off-dry wine. It has a delicate spice character along with yellow fruits that are seasoned with pepper and acidity. Drink now.",Kuehn 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
1838,"This herbaceous Cabernet also contains 17% Petite Sirah but doesn't take that variety's character on as much as it does the more herbal Bordeaux grapes, namely Cab and Cab Franc. Earthy and somewhat austere, the wine is a blend of cassis and green pepper.",Long Meadow Ranch 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1839,"Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish.",Mario Bazán 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1840,"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying.",Medlock Ames 2011 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
1841,"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over.",Peirano 2012 The Other Red (Lodi)
1842,"Sweet and somewhat disjointed, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc offers ripe apricot and peach before becoming slightly sour and herbal on the finish.",Marilyn Sauvignon Blonde 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
1843,"Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.",Zudugarai 2013 White (Getariako Txakolina)
1844,Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.,Cascada Peak 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
1845,"Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully.",Bouza de Carril 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)

1847,"Aromas of raw oak, paint and dark-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate with candied, oaky, mildly bitter black cherry and plum flavors. A modest finish closes with lasting bitterness and medicinality.",Montevicor 2010 Garnacha (Calatayud)
1848,"Grassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash.",Maximo 2012 Edicion Limitada Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
1849,"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way.",Witching Stick 2012 Fashauer Vineyard Zinfandel (Anderson Valley)

1853,"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",EdenVale 2007 Syrah (Rogue Valley)
1854,"Prune and raisin aromas announce ripeness, which comes with woodsy, earthy, murky berry scents. This feels snappy at first, then more heavy and baked. Prune and spice cake flavors are clumsy, heavy and lack cohesion on the finish.",Alto Cinco 2012 Paniza Garnacha (Cariñena)
1855,"This is stalky, grassy and peppery smelling, with red-berry aromas. Rawness and sharp acidity keep the pulse up as basic flavors of plum and raisin take over. A modest finish keeps the course without evolving.",Black Box 2013 Malbec (Mendoza)
1856,"An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.",Hendry 2011 Hendry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1857,"This has both a taste of vanilla-sugar on the palate and bristling acidity that demands attention, making for a wine that's slightly off-kilter. The presence of oak is restrained and the finish, in keeping with the theme, quite tart.",White Oak 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
1858,"This GSM blend is soft and muted. It falls flat, with dull fruit and a wash of chocolate.",Merrill Cellars 2012 Cotes du Rogue G-S-M (Oregon)

1860,"Fresh blackberry fruits give a smooth wine, rich and with an immediately attractive fresh acidity. It does have the density of fruit along with relatively soft tannins. At the back there is a more chocolate character.",Château Beausejour-Duffau-Lagarrosse 2009  Saint-Émilion
1861,This wine continues the upward progression of Clerc-Milon. It has weight and density while also showing sweetness and delicious acidity. A very complete wine.,Château Clerc Milon 2009  Pauillac
1862,"There is dense, ripe fruit here, although with an austere, serious edge. The wine has firm yet juicy blackberry fruits along with concentrated tannins. It is firm, dark, with the potential for good red berry fruits.",Château Magdelaine 2009  Saint-Émilion
1863,"So soft and sweet, it's like a melted dessert pastry. Explodes in blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with the smoky, buttery toast of oak barrels. Defines deliciousness. The tannins are soft enough to drink this 100% Cabernet now, and it is probably best enjoyed over the next six years before it loses freshness.",Hundred Acre 2008 Few and Far Between Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1864,"Tinata is a sultry blend of Syrah and Grenache, a Rhône-style blend unlike any other wine in the area. These grapes seem perfectly adapted to the little-known region of Capalbio in the southern part of Tuscany and deliver intense aromas of blackberry, leather, chocolate and cured meat. It's plush, rich and extremely long-lasting.",Monteverro 2008 Tinata Red (Toscana)
1865,"Siepi is a gorgeous 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that delivers intense aromas of ripe black fruit, rum cake, leather, moist tobacco and Indian spice.

1867,"A stunning Syrah with 4% Viognier that's almost black in color and aching with deep, dark cherry and black licorice surrounded by a lush, dense herb garden.

1868,"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.",Quilceda Creek 2008 Palengat Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
1869,"Poggio al Merli is a 100% Merlot that shows a perfect marriage between variety and territory. It's an opulent, soft and round wine that is woven tight with blackberry, pipe tobacco, rum cake and a touch of black olive. Velvety tannins drive a long, intense finish.",Castellare di Castellina 2009 Poggio ai Merli Merlot (Toscana)
1870,"Pitch-black wine, very dense. It is spicy with concentrated black fruits, layered with equally intense acidity. Wood, fruit and sweet berries are all there. Tannins surround this firm wine, promising aging over 5–6 years.",Castro Pena Alba 2007 Picos de Couto Grande Escolha Red (Dão)
1871,"With layers of wood, this is a structured wine, driven as much by tannins as fruit. It will need time for the dark plum fruit flavors to come through—St.-Estèphe is always likely to be firmly textured.",Château de Pez 2009  Saint-Estèphe
1872,"Initially wood dominates, but this is a stage after bottling. Because then the ripe, smooth fruit comes in, pouring through with black fruits, very ripe and juicy. As this wine develops, this rich fruit will be its main character.",Château Gruaud Larose 2009  Saint-Julien
1873,"The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!",Doyenne 2009 Métier Red (Yakima Valley)
1874,"It's sad that only 5,080 bottles of this wine were produced, as it's truly a stunner. Dark and developed, complex and concentrated, this wine exhibits such superb balance and finesse, with nuanced notes of minerality, scrubland, whole tobacco leaf, black pepper and licorice root all gracing the dark fruit core of the nose and mouth. It's lush and full on the palate, and medium tannins provide a solid structure, making the wine drinkable now or ready to age.",Gérard Bertrand 2008 L'Hospitalitas - La Clape Red (Coteaux du Languedoc)
1875,"One of the nicest Syrahs to come from Italy, Marchesale is a rich, inky wine with intense aromas of cherry, blueberry, cola, chocolate and leather. Balanced softness and freshness characterize the finish.",Terre del Marchesato 2008 Marchesale Syrah (Toscana)
1876,"This wonderful Brunello opens with sultry aromas of black fruit, cherry, spice, leather and tobacco. It's a rich and penetrating wine with a soft, lush mouthfeel and a hint of crisp acidity on the close.

1878,"Based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this luxe rosé bubbly is delicious to drink now. It's likeable for the array of strawberry, orange and lime flavors, with that savory sparkling wine yeastiness, and the bubbles are smooth and refined. Will set off many different foods, but sushi is a definite hit.",Chandon NV Etoile Rosé Sparkling (Sonoma-Napa)
1879,"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish.",Château du Tertre 2009  Margaux
1880,"Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture.",Château La Conseillante 2009  Pomerol
1881,"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.",Chester Kidder 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
1882,"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat.",Dunham 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
1883,"The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity.",Patz & Hall 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
1884,"A rich wine, full of dark plums, big and dusty tannins and a powerful core of dryness. The wood aging has brought out mint as well as spice, smoothing the rough edges to give an impressive and elegant finish. Keep for 4–5 years.",Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2007 Vinhas Velhas de Santa Maria Baga (Beiras)
1885,"This massive super Tuscan blend based mostly on Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is thick, inky dark in color and particularly intense this vintage. Black cherry, spice, plum cake and leather are protagonists of the bouquet. The mouthfeel is smooth and incredibly rich.",Tenuta Monteti 2004 Monteti Red (Toscana)
1886,"Big, bold and structured, this is a dry yet mouthwatering beast of a Shiraz, its blackberry, mocha and black olive notes held in check by firm tannins. Give it 3–4 years in the cellar, then drink it over the next several years.",Henry's Drive Vignerons 2008 Reserve Shiraz (Padthaway)
1887,"A distinguished, impressive Cabernet, obviously the result of fine grapegrowing and meticulous berry selection. It's bone dry, rich in tannins and firm, with mineral-infused blackberry and black currant flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years.",Volker Eisele Family Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1888,"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years.",Angel Vine 2009 The Hellion Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

1890,"A product of a hot, short growing season, Lake Folly's 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon shows some slightly overripe notes of cola and prune, but also features a high degree of richness allied to a broad, mouthfilling texture. It lacks nuance, but it is a big, flavorful mouthful that ends with hints of coffee and chocolate. Drink now–2010.",Lake Breeze 2003 Follett Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek)
1891,"Softer and more approachable than the winery's powerful 2005, this wine offers lush plum, leather and loam notes, accented by a touch of cracked pepper. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a soft finish that invites another sip. Drink now–2012.",Longview 2006 Devils Elbow Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaide Hills)
1892,"Aglianico and Piedirosso grapes are blended to produce a thick and broad wine with an inky black color and notes of very ripe red fruit. It has a sweet, chewy aspect with vibrant, albeit densely extracted fruit and soaring tannins. Try it with a beef stew or similarly heavy dishes.",Villa Matilde 2003 Red (Falerno del Massico)
1893,"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",Williams Selyem 2005 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
1894,"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink now–2012.",Craneford 2005 Allyson Parsons Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley)
1895,"Feudi di San Gregorio's distinctive take on the indigenous Greco variety favors a more saturated and concentrated style. The color  is slightly more golden and intense and the aromas reveal ripe melon, honey, dried hay and almond.",Feudi di San Gregorio 2005  Greco di Tufo
1896,"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",Ponzi 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
1897,"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.",Razor's Edge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
1898,"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",Torres 2003 Reserva Real Red (Penedès)
1899,"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.",Carlos Basso 2006 Dos Fincas Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Uco Valley)
1900,"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate. The dominant flavor is fresh cut pear, and the creamy texture spreads the flavors broadly through the mouth. A lovely wine to match with halibut or swordfish.",Daedalus 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
1901,"This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness.",La Chablisienne 2005 Côte de Léchet Premier Cru  (Chablis)
1902,"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",Piattelli 2005 Premium Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
1903,"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so.",Strathewen Hills 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley)
1904,"This boasts brilliant clarity, purity and aromas of orange blossom, pear, melon and peach. It's a tad flatter and creamier than other renditions of this native grape but nonetheless would make an idea match to fish, pasta salad or most chicken dishes.",Di Meo 2003 Alessandra  (Fiano di Avellino)
1905,"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008–2010.",Hendry 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
1906,"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",Ànima Negra 2004 Àn Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears)
1907,"Apricot, peach cobbler, sticky honey, white flower and macadamia nut color a seductively sweet wine from Puglia, the heel of the Italian “boot.” Thanks to strong sunshine and cooling breezes, Malvasia grapes lose their water mass, resulting in rich concentration and intense fragrances.",Botromagno 2001 Gravisano Passito Malvasia Bianca (Murgia)
1908,"A soft, medium-bodied wine that tends toward bright, red-berried fruit, this is a solid everyday Cabernet. Cedar and tobacco-leaf notes accent the cherry-berry fruit, while hints of vanilla and caramel linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now.",Nugan Family Estates 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)
1909,"A real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine. Cola and coffee notes accent plum and blackberry flavors, while the broad texture coats the mouth with soft tannins. Drink now–2012.",Shingleback 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
1910,"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.",Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Wetzel Family Estate Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
1911,"A nice interpretation of Grenache Blanc. Blended with a drop of Viognier, it shows notes of orange and peach jam, honey, vanilla and toasty oak. The alcohol level is high. Drink up.",Summerwood 2012 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles)
1912,"For lovers of red sparkling wine with its attendant tannins, this is a fine example. It has a definite Pinot Noir farmyard character along with tannins, a touch of smokiness, and a definite need for food.",Steininger 2010 Sekt Pinot Noir (Österreichischer Sekt)
1913,"There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus.",AntoLin Cellars 2011 Estate Riesling (Yakima Valley)
1914,"Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2–3 years.",Calicaro 2010 Les Fauves White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara)
1915,"Crusty aromas of black fruits mesh nicely with lemon peel and floral scents. The acidity here is noticeably high, which creates a scouring mouthfeel. Short flavors of berry and cassis are shrill, while the body and cushion offered by this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier are modest at best.",Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Viognier Red (Colchagua Valley)
1916,"Rubbery red-berry aromas blend with spicy field scents to create a true Pinot nose that's a bit strained. This is intense, chunky and slightly herbal, with red-fruit flavors, spice notes and some heat and oak on the finish.",Emiliana 2011 Novas Gran Reserva Made with Organically Grown Grapes Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
1917,"Hay, straw, match stick and minerally aromas outweigh this wine's fruit scents by a measurable margin. This is chunky and a bit soft in the mouth, a reflection of 2012's heat. And while it's round as a ball, it's slightly vegetal and bitter tasting on the palate, with grapefruit and bell pepper flavors.",Errazuriz 2012 Max Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley)
1918,"This solid, structured wine has black currant fruit, balanced acidity and firm tannins. The wine has a solid texture, a core of dryness and the potential to age 3–4 years.",Château Belrose 2011  Bordeaux
1919,"Under the serious amount of wood, this wine feels rich and concentrated. Wood spice, a touch burnt, along with chocolate and black currant fruit show both extraction and the need for 2–3 years' aging.",Château de Lestiac 2011  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
1920,"Solid and tannic, very firm from the opening to the finish. It is based around a dark core of wood and spice as well as more juicy fruit flavors. The wine needs time to round out and bring more of the juiciness to the fore.",Château les Mottes Pradier 2011  Côtes de Bourg
1921,This is a rare beast from Washington—single vineyard Tempranillo aged in neutral oak coming in at less than 13% alcohol. It's soft and light with notes of red fruit and refreshing acidity that drops off on the back half.,Cor Cellars 2011 E Cor Si Move Tempranillo 24K Vineyard Tempranillo (Wahluke Slope)
1922,"Grape and spice aromas give this wine a distinctive heady perfume. A rare style to find in the Wachau, it brings a fine balance between fruit and perfume with the textured nature of Wachau wines. Ready to drink, or age for a year. Screwcap.",Domäne Wachau 2012 Terrassen Gelber Muskateller (Wachau)
1923,"Easy to drink this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, with Merlot predominating. It's all about cherries, blackberries, plum jam, currants and chocolate. Not particularly subtle or ageworthy, but very pretty.",Happy Canyon Vineyard 2010 Piocho Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
1924,"This opens with a good mix of tobacco, black cherry, cola and mocha aromas. In the mouth, this offers good body, size and balance along with lightly herbal, leafy flavors of mossy black fruits. A mellow finish with a solid structure is a welcome ending.",Viña Bisquertt 2011 La Joya Gran Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
1925,"This opens with evident oak aromas of toasted wood, espresso and coffee bean followed by underpinnings of black fruit and pepper. The palate shows ripe black fruit, espresso and oak. Although it has nice depth, the finish is cut short by by drying wood tannins.",Virna Borgogno 2009 Cannubi Boschis  (Barolo)
1926,"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit.",Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
1927,"Dense planting for this vineyard has resulted in a wine that has greater concentration than in the past. The wine has firm tannins, while showing already delicious black-currant fruit. For drinking over the next 2–4 years.",Pezat 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur
1928,"This is a pretty, well-made Barbera with an invitingly floral and fruity bouquet. The palate shows ripe black-fruit flavors accompanied by touches of spice, coffee and chocolate. This would be perfect with grilled meats.",Pico Maccario 2011 Tre Rovere  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)

1934,"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.",Mitolo 2009 Reiver Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
1935,"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy.

1936,"With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors.

1938,"A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite.

1947,"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak.

1953,"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",SuLei 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
1954,"On the nose, this Cab delivers a mix of vinegar, rubber and jumpy berry aromas. The palate is smooth but bland and soft, while flavors of licorice, prune and herbal notes finish easy.",Valle Secreto 2010 First Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley)

1958,"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body.

Delicious now and for a few years.",Stephanie 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley)
1959,"Rich, exotic notes of honey-glazed papaya and warm pear are accented by touches of white flower, graham cracker and lemon custard.

A clean, honest Pinot to enjoy now.",Laroche 2010 Viña Punto Alto Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
1966,"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth.

1991,"Initial plum and berry aromas fall off with airing and reveal notes of chemical and chewing gum dust. On the palate, this blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Tannat is chewy, sticky and flat.

2011,"Amid the blackberry and asphalt tones, this has a funky rubber twist on the nose. The bottling is a side label of Avelina, founded by former Oreana Winery owner Christian Garvin. It's tart and sour on the palate, with dried raspberries and a bit more funk.",Sands Point 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)

2044,"Barolo Bricco delle Viole is a lush and generous wine with a bright ruby color and attractively intense aromas of cherry, wild berry, nutmeg, clove, powdered licorice and root beer. The oak influence is still obvious at this early stage, but will no doubt integrate with time. The mouthfeel is exceedingly soft, smooth and velvety. You don't need to wait too many years before uncorking this bottle.",G D Vajra 2006 Bricco delle Viole  (Barolo)
2045,"Very different from the Bricco delle Viole cru expression from the same producer, this wine offers bold, ripe fruit with lingering tones of red cherry, leather, charcoal and campfire. The fruit is thick and succulent and the finish offers sweet, succulent spice flavors. Multiple U.S. importers.",G D Vajra 2006 Luigi Baudana Cerretta  (Barolo)
2046,"This Barolo with the vocally challenging name Pichemej reveals a dark and moody side that is reinforced by aromas of black fruit, plum, pressed rose, tar and asphalt.

2052,"A beautifully accessible wine, polished, pretty and likeable now for its gentle texture and silky tannins. The sweet cherry and raspberry fruit is encircled with a coat of fancy smoked oak.

2053,"Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors.

2054,"Here's a very attractive and seductive Barolo with chiseled mineral tones that really help the wine stand out in a crowd.

2056,"Mario Battaglio offers a truly fantastic expression of Nebbiolo from the hot 2007 vintage that is packed tight with intensity and larger than life aromatic opulence.

2057,"Barolo Bricco Rocca still needs a few more years in the cellar to allow for full integrations of its spice, fruit, tobacco and mineral components. This beautiful wine is ripe with potential and the mouthfeel is plush and velvety with a wonderful fade of smoke and black fruit. Drink after 2018.",Cascina Ballarin 2006 Bricco Rocca  (Barolo)
2058,"Here's a wine that begs a pairing with a truffle dish: black truffle Cornish hen or creamy risotto with white truffle flakes would do the trick.

2063,"From 100% grand cru Chardonnay vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a rich but almost bone-dry wine. It has a great mineral character that offers freshness, apple skins and a flinty edge.

2064,"From a cool part of the valley, this wine is marked by fresh acids that give it a grapey jamminess. It's very rich in black cherries, black raspberries and toast, and very dry.

An interesting wine, and one to watch.",Twisted Oak 2007 River of Skulls Dalton Vineyard Red (Calaveras County)
2067,"A very fine Cabernet, dry and firm, but it needs a little time in the cellar.

Try between 2010–2012.",Waypoint 2006 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
2068,"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth.

Nice details of leaf and leather run richly into the tannins.",Whitman Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
2069,"A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years.",Wild Oak by St. Francis 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)

2072,"This is a thickly extracted Amarone with fruit-driven aromas of strawberry, cherry and blackberry preserves.

2074,"Lamorèmio is a blend of Nerello Mascalese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola in equal parts that tastes of Indian spice, clove, sweet cinnamon and blackberry. You'll also get a touch of caper or green olive that rides on the heels of the wine's smooth, supple mouthfeel.",Benanti 2005 Lamorèmio Red (Sicilia)
2075,"Il Monovitigno is a pure expression of Nerello Mascalese—Mt. Etna's most promising variety—with aromas of black olive, Indian spice, mesquite, black fruit and volcanic ash.

Best now–2011.",Long Meadow Ranch 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
2083,"Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs.

Only 300 cases produced.",Marchiori & Barraud 2007 Cuartel 2 Marchiori Vineyard Malbec (Perdriel)

Good, slightly herbal and long on the finish.",Morandé 2007 Edición Limitada Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
2085,"It's hard to make Petite Sirah smooth and elegant, but Newsome-Harlow has done it.

2088,"Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors.

The wine has weight, delicious white fruits and kiwi, and a textured mouthfeel. It is concentrated, certainly in a food wine style.",Soutiran NV Brut Grand Cru  (Champagne)
2090,"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla.

2104,"Ripe, smooth, just veering toward rustic, but also showing a fine balance of tannins and sweet fruit. It is certainly rich, while the spicy character, with the dried fruits, is generous. The acidity is understated.",Cortes de Cima 2005 Aragonez Aragonês (Alentejano)
2105,"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of Carmenère, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors. Ripeness is clearly not an issue as it shows no vegetal or herbal notes. Simply big, bold and not terribly unique.",De Martino 2006 Legado Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley)

2112,"Here's an interesting rosé fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard. This wine also stays an entire year in tank resting on its lees, so it's not a fruit-forward rosé at all.

2120,There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts.

2125,"A very rich wine—this has a warm, soft mouthfeel and ripe, jammy flavors enhanced with oak. Except for the heat, it's a lovely wine. Drink now.",Justin 2008 Isoceles Reserve Red (Paso Robles)
2126,"Easily as good as Chardonnays costing two or three times as much, this is a great value, and with production at 12,000 cases, it should be fairly easy to find.

2131,"Everything in this wine is strong and obvious: With its powerful tropical fruit, sweet oak and intense finish, this is what many Americans like in Chardonnay. But as impressive as the winemaker's art is here, the flash is all on the surface. Drink up.",Freeman 2010 Ryo-Fu Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
2132,"Smooth and rich, this has superripe Merlot. It has soft, jammy red-fruit flavors and tannins that are enveloped by the opulent texture. The tannins should allow the wine to age over 3–6 years.",Horeau-Beylot 2010 Château la Fleur Poitou  (Lussac Saint-Émilion)

2250,"A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015.",Kazmer & Blaise 2009 Primo's Hill Pinot Noir (Carneros)
2251,"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014.",Kirkland Signature 2007 Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
2252,"A bit disjointed, with acidity sticking out, and the fruit tending toward jammy blackberries, raspberries and nectarines, leading to sharpness in the finish. Could mellow and improve in a couple years.",Mantra 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
2253,"A good Cab, chockful of grilled blackberry, cassis, cocoa and sweet smoky oak flavors that finish rich and spicy. Has some real elegance, at an affordable price.",Turn Four 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
2254,"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game. For immediate drinking.",Viña Cobos 2007 Felino Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
2255,"Rich, savory and appealing now for its smooth texture and forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries and oak. A lovely wine for grilled steaks and chops.",X 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
2256,"Not a wine for the faint of heart. Alluring notes of raspberry, blackberry, smoke and coconut set the scene for powerful flavors of strawberry and black pepper in the mouth. Tannins are abundant but polished. The finish is a bit of a disappointment, with a whisper of astringency and a huge hit of coconut. Still, well done and fairly priced. Drink with steak.",Ballast Stone Estate Wines 2006 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
2257,"Pro Nobis is a good example of the Ruché grape (a mysterious variety from Piedmont with some similarities to Brachetto). The wine offers aromas of wild berries and blue violets, backed by medium consistency and bright acidity. Pair it with cheesy pasta dishes.",Cantine Sant'Agata 2007 Pro Nobis  (Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato)
2258,"86-88 Barrel sample. Densely structured wine, all rich plums and berry fruit flavors. There is a strong amount of wood, but it is the juicy, just green, character of the wine which is most prominent.",Château la Tour de By 2008 Barrel sample  (Médoc)
2259,"86-88 Barrel sample An aroma that is almost port-like in its sweetness. To taste, the structure is lost in a swathe of ripeness that covers the fruit.",Château Larrivet Haut-Brion 2008 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan)
2260,"Tonic and fresh with vibrant tones of wild berry and forest floor, there is a rustic, almost savage quality to this wine that is really quite attractive. It would pair well with home-cooked meals of hand-kneaded pasta or boiled meats.",Colle dei Venti 2006  Barbera d'Asti
2261,"86-88 Barrel sample. Firm, with a bitter, tight edge, this has high acidity, spice, and a tight layer of tannins. For a second wine, this is not that accessible.",La Chapelle de Potensac 2008 Barrel sample  (Médoc)
2262,"One of Italy's most interesting and least-know wines, Sforzato di Valetellina is made with dried Nebbiolo grapes in much the same way Amarone is made. In fact, sforzato means “forced” in Italian and alludes to the extra concentration given to the wine. With herbal and some bitter, leafy green notes, it's not a wine for everyone; it's sour in the mouth with an acid-driven close.",Salis 1637 2002 Canua  (Valtellina Superiore)
2263,"There's a tonic quality to this Pinot Nero that combines ashy mineral notes with wild berries, toasted almonds and blue flowers. There's also a warm, sun-drenched quality that adds to the overall intensity and concentration.",La Scolca 2004 Pinot Nero (Oltrepò Pavese)
2264,"86-88 Barrel sample. Despite its initial edge of bitterness, this develops as a dense wine, packed with dark high toast and blackberry jelly flavors. The final bite of high extract spoils the finish.",Château Malescasse 2008 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc)
2265,"This is the lightest of the Grüners from Proidl, offering a refreshing burst of crisp acidity along with the freshest spice. There is a fine tang of lemon, to keep the whole wine as bright as possible.",Proidl 2008 Senftenberger Freiheit Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
2266,"Andy Beckstoffer is starting to release wines from his Red Hills vineyards, and this release is promising, especially at this price.

Rich and savory, this Cab delivers lots to like.",Seventy Five Wine Co. 2006 Amber Knolls Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)
2267,"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against.",St. Francis 2007 Rowe Vineyard Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
2268,"Made in a lighter style, this silky Pinot Noir has crisp acidity accentuating flavors of cherries, red licorice and cola. It's an elegant wine for drinking now.",Stephen's 2006 Stromsoe Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
2269,"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel that shows the variety's rustic, briary character. It's dry and tannic and rather high in alcohol, with flavors of wild, ripe forest berries, peppery spices, currants, bacon and sweet, smoky cedar. Nice now with BBQ.",Adobe Road 2006 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)

2275,"Oak dominates the overall character of this wine, with forward notes of toasted wood, tobacco leaf, roasted coffee bean and a hint of plum. There's more wood than fruit here.",Bindi Sergardi 2010  Chianti Classico
2276,"Made from Sangiovese and a bit of Colorino, this has an earthy nose of truffle and underbrush, with a hint of iris and a whiff of leather. Reflecting the forward nature of the vintage, the palate is soft and warm, with sweet wild cherry, plum and round tannins. Drink soon.",Corte alla Flora 2011  Rosso di Montepulciano
2277,"There's no denying the fact that this smells stalky and burnt, with leathery fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's choppy, with scratchy acidity leading to a loud flavor profile with stalky berry, raisin and stewed flavors. Heat and additional roasted notes drive the finish on this Malbec.",Alpamanta 2009 Estate Malbec (Mendoza)
2278,"This blend of undisclosed varieties is a charming red wine to drink now. It's dry, smooth and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Beef is its natural partner.",Buena Vista 2011 The Count Founder's Red (Sonoma County)

2281,"Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish.",Emerson 2012 Viognier (Willamette Valley)
2282,"This shows delicate floral aromas along with dominant bell pepper and sawdust sensations. The palate is dominated by oaky flavors of roasted coffee beans and espresso, giving the wine an anonymous personality and style.",Fattoria di Montecchio 2010  Chianti Classico
2283,"Aged mostly in stainless steel with a touch of new French oak (10%), this has notes of toast and char along with freshly cut mango. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, drinking just a hair off dry with a bitter note on the finish.",Girardet 2011 Chardonnay (Umpqua Valley)
2284,"Albariño is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.",Lusco 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
2285,"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",Damalisco 2008 Crianza  (Toro)

2288,"The Cabernet Moravia grape is a cross between Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt.

2290,"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano.",Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 362 Red (California)
2291,"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.",Casarena 2011 Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza)

2293,"This deeply saturated wine opens with a nice balance of ripe, chewy fruit, vanilla and spice.

2295,"Pian delle Vigne's 2004 Brunello is worlds apart from the scorching hot 2003 vintage—so different, in fact, the wine seems utterly reborn.

2296,"Bold and modern, Fonterutoli delivers the goods year after year. The wine is rich and plush with deep concentration and excellent intensity.

2298,"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion.

2299,"Verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar.

2300,"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality.

Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Musenhang Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
2301,"Compared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010.",Highlands 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
2302,"The nose has a ripe plum and savory spice character in this sophisticated red. On the palate, cedar, mocha and pepper give it a rich, brooding quality. Tannins are fine but ageable. The finish is lingering and spicy. Pair now with richer meat dishes; give it a few years to age and it will be even better.",Vergelegen 2005 Mill Race Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Stellenbosch)
2303,"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State.

Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years.",Arbor Crest 2006 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
2304,"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins.

2308,"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.",Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
2309,"One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it.

2311,"The relatively low residual sugar in this wine gives it a leaner feel than Mosbacher's other 2007s, but the fruit comes through as lime, grapefruit and passion fruit, marked by Forst's prominent minerality. Very crisp and long; would pair well with many seafood dishes.",Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Elster Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
2312,"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years.

2369,"This opens with funky but not unpleasant aromas that soon burn off to reveal earthy notes and mature black fruit.

2558,"Fresh and tempting, this has a hot-pink color and flavors like watermelon and cherry. With medium body and even a light touch of tannin, it's more meaty than many rosés, so you can serve it with the meal as well as for an apéritif.",Las Positas 2014 Estate Rosé (Livermore Valley)
2559,"Sanguine in cedar, pencil lead and tea, this wine's elegant opening gives way to ripe black fruit and thick, burly tannins. The finish is marked in vanilla oak and a taste of cigar.",In Re 2010 You be the judge! Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

2561,"Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc.

2562,"Aromas of ripe berry, Mediterranean herb, menthol and eucalyptus lead the nose.

2563,"This long-aged blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Petite Sirah is plump on the oaky nose with condensed rose petal, chocolate cake and violet aromas.

2564,"Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish.",Zocker 2014 Paragon Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley)
2565,"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number.",Hannes Reeh 2014 Rohstoff Chardonnay (Burgenland)
2566,"This wine could be labeled a Cabernet Sauvignon, which makes up 83% of the blend, with the rest Merlot. The aromas of fruit leather, dried blackberry, black licorice and medicine cabinet are bright, though they seem considerably more evolved than the wine's age might indicate.

2576,"Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) make up the majority of this wine with the balance Malbec.

The oak gets a bit out-front but the wine still has much to offer.",Stottle 2012 Big Eddie Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
2577,"Blue-fruit aromas intermingle with vanilla and other barrel spices. The coffee and plum flavors are full and supple in feel, followed by a tart finish. The wood seems a bit primary but the fruit and feel is still hard to ignore.",Stottle 2012 Elerding 6 Prong Malbec (Horse Heaven Hills)
2578,"Bright aromas of freshly roasted coffee beans, brown stems, dried herbs, purple flowers, mineral and black pepper are followed by ethereally light fruit and savory flavors that focus on elegance.

It offers generous aromas of blueberry puree, dried herbs, red fruit, woodspice, dried flowers and mineral. The flavors bring the same but are more pulled-back than the aromas suggest, with a bit of astringency that holds the wine back.",Amavi 2013 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))

The coffee and blue-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry, showing pleasing depth.",Brian Carter Cellars NV One Upland Vineyard Touriga Nacional (Snipes Mountain)
2583,"Specks of rosemary give the aromatic entry of this wine a nice herbal invitation. This subtlety is followed by more bombastic waves of big, juicy black cherry, berry and oak. The tannins are still substantial, suggesting cellaring, through 2021.",Charthia 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
2584,"The gravel soil on this Lévèque family property makes a great place to grow white grapes. A 50/50 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, this fresh wine suggests the ability to age.

2587,"The most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea.

Drink now–2020+.",Frankland Estate 2012 Poison Hill Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River)
2588,"This is a serious wine, despite the ripe fruitiness on its surface. It is full of peach and mango flavors, but structured by a cool, mineral feel. Tangy acidity and tight texture adds tension. It still needs to age 2–4 years. Screwcap.",Graf Hardegg 2010 Steinbügel Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)

2590,"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised.",àMaurice 2010 Gamache Vineyard Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
2591,"This traditionally styled Barolo has a classic fragrance of violet, rose and leather, with balsamic notes.

2592,"This shows enticing aromas of mint, spice and balsamic herbs and delivers a restrained palate of black cherry, with undertones of sage, white pepper, coffee and espresso. This is still aggressively tannic and needs time to soften.",Barale Fratelli 2009 Castellero  (Barolo)

2594,"Made in a superripe, dense, almost fudge-like style, The Ripper tastes like a plummy, chocolaty Christmas cake with slightly coarse tannins on the finish.

2602,"La Clarine Farm's rosé is slightly cloudy, sourced mostly from Syrah grapes, with unusual additions of Mourvèdre, Sémillon and Viognier. Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine.

2603,"Oak, resin, vanilla and creamy aromas run side by side with cherry, cassis and berry scents on this blend of Cabernet, Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Syrah.

Drink through 2017.",La Playa 2010 Axel Primero Red (Colchagua Valley)
2604,"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak.

The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros.",Maldonado 2011 Los Olivos Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
2605,This Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.,Medlock Ames 2008 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
2606,"Earthy aromas include pencil eraser, wild herbs and eucalyptus along with tea and blackberry. This is very smooth and lush in the mouth, a reflection of a warm vintage.

2607,"This wine from the Santa Carolina family opens with ripe blackberry, prune and minerally aromas.

Additional richness is provided by barrel fermentation and the addition of a little Sémillon.",Bougetz 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
2611,"This is a solid value in the world of Cabernet. Textbook notes of cassis and mint lead the way, framed by supple tannins and dressed up with hints of graham crackers and black tea.

2612,"This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast.

2613,"Tantalizing spice notes mix with aromas of quince and lanolin on this fabulous bargain Riesling.

2627,"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches.",Congress Springs 2006 Chardonnay (California)

2633,"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão.

2661,"The nose of this wine leads with forward oak and vanilla aromas. The palate offers more personality and ripe, luscious fruit flavors, with additional notes of spice and toast. While it shows some complexity, it's fast approaching its optimum drinking window, so enjoy soon.",Zymè 2006  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
2662,"As big as you expect a Howell Mountain Zin to be, offering rich, deep blackberry, currant, chocolate, licorice, bacon and cedar flavors that are sweet and dry at the same time. It's not just powerful in flavor, it's wonderful in structure, with refined tannins and balancing acidity. A minor criticism is some heat from alcohol, but that's the nature of ripe Zinfandel.",Howell Mountain Vineyards 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
2663,"Conflict is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc. Smoke wreathes around deep cherry candy flavors, leading into some chewy tannins dusted with savory herbs.",J. Bookwalter 2010 Conner Lee Vineyard Conflict Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
2664,"This lush Chardonnay has a certain oiliness to the aromas, along with dusty, toasty components that ride through a soft, plush mid-palate. The fruit is a rich mix of peach and apricot, highlighted with toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and coconut.",Januik 2011 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
2665,"Dry spice is fighting with rich, smooth Chardonnay to give a wine that is unbalanced at the moment. It is full, fragrant, still young so the dried almond edge should melt into the more honeyed character. Drink from 2017.",Umathum 2011 Beerenauslese White (Burgenland)
2666,"This is rich in black cherry flavors, with layered accents of white pepper, almond and walnut. It's the perfect marriage between the elegance of Valpolicella and the structure of Amarone. Imported by Panebianco, Vinity Wine Company.",Venturini Massimino 2009 Semonte Alto  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
2667,"This sparkling wine is one of the best from Chandon in years. There's a soft refinement to the mousse, making it just as good as its more expensive rivals. Shows complex flavors of yeast, limes, oranges, vanilla and honey.",Chandon 2008 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Yountville)
2668,"This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization. It's dry and smooth in tannins. Best of all is an acidity and minerality that lend structure. Drink now–2015.",Frazier 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
2669,"Ripe, jammy black-fruit sensations dominate the nose and mouth of this wine, with lush, expressive notes of blackberry, black raspberry and boysenberry preserves. The texture is like crushed satin, with medium-plus yet fine tannins and a cocoa-kissed finish. Enjoyable now, but should develop additional complexities after 2016.",Domaine Cabirau 2011 Serge & Nicolas Red (Maury Sec)
2670,"Give this Cabernet high marks for sheer lusciousness. It's ripe in blackberries, black cherries and currants, with a veneer of sweet oak. Not a longterm ager, so drink over the next five years.",Frias 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
2671,"This is a concentrated, firm and tannic wine. It has a structured feel from Chiroubles, which are the highest vineyards in Beaujolais. With its black fruits, dark tannins and concentrated texture, it could certainly age for 2–3 years, although it is ready to drink now.",Georges Duboeuf 2011 Domaine des Pontheux  (Chiroubles)
2672,"Showing some mature notes at the age of four years or so, with a mellow texture framing cherry pie, cola and spice flavors. Feels silky, lush and delightful. Drink now–2015 as the fruit gradually fades away.",Orentano 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)

Flavors of leafy, spicy berry and plum finish with peppery notes, a jolt of salinity and heft.",Riglos 2010 Gran Las Divas Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Tupungato)
2674,"This is vibrant and expressive, with upfront purple-flower fragrances of violet and iris mixed with fruity tones of boysenberry and raspberry sauce. The crushed-silk texture offers medium tannins, ample acidity and skin-driven fruit flavors. Roasted coffee bean and sweet smoke accents mark the lingering finish.",Les Villages de Terroir Catalan 2010 Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages Caramany)
2675,"This is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 3% Syrah. It's toasty to the max, with scents and flavors of coffee and smoke as much as berry and cassis. There is great acid/tannin balance and some additional years of bottle age should help to bring out more of the fruit.",J. Bookwalter 2010 Foreshadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
2676,"Leaner and tighter than this bottling has been the previous few vintages, this wine is showing hard tannins obscure in plum, black cherry pie and mocha flavors. Yet it's a balanced wine, which should develop bottle complexity after 2016.",Keller Estate 2010 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
2677,"L'Ecole tackles, with great success, two of the least-recognized strengths of Washington viticulture: Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. Here the blend includes 13% Sauvignon Blanc. It's well built, full bodied, with a mix of citrus and stone fruits, generous acidity, and some finishing skin flavors putting a slightly bitter frame around it.",L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA))
2678,"This wine is mostly Sémillon, with Sauvignon Blanc filling in the rest. It's one of the rare white wines from the Walla Walla AVA, graceful, full-bodied and tasting of fig and green banana. Just recently bottled, it still carries a bit of yeast in the nose and in the finish. Give it another few months to pull itself together.",L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Seven Hills Vineyard Estate Luminesce Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
2679,"Coming from the Basque country, this blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat is both perfumed and firmly structured. It is a solid wine, showing its wood aging while bringing out great ripe berry fruits. Drink from 2014.",Lionel Osmin & Cie 2011 Donibane Red (Irrouléguy)
2680,"Inox is the winery's unoaked Chardonnay, the first of the vintage. This bottling provides a promising glimpse into the quality of the 2012s. It's so rich and ripe in citrus and tropical fruits, you won't miss the barrel influence. Try now with sushi, tuna tartare, or a salad of bitter greens, tropical fruits and feta cheese.",Melville 2012 Clone 76 Inox Estate Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
2681,"A larger selection from Signal Ridge, Bravium's main bottling is still tiny production, light on its feet and aromatic in rose petal and violet. With notes of black cherry and pomegranate its tannins are silky and the wine deliciously priced.",Bravium 2011 Signal Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge)
2682,"Givry is one of the unsung values in Burgundy. This ripe and structured wine shows why. It has weight, a firm texture and red plum and strawberry fruit flavors. All these elements are held together by a dark sense of tannin and fine acidity.",Antonin Rodet 2010  Givry
2683,"Earthy, mildly leafy aromas of dried red fruits and vanilla are textbook for Rioja gran reserva. A medium-bodied palate shows balsamic richness along with flavors of prune, raisin, cassis and loamy earth. This is mild but solid on the finish, with a quick fade to the fruit component. Drink now.",Bodegas Muriel 2004 Viña Muriel Gran Reserva  (Rioja)

This is direct and powerfully structured.",Zenato 2007 Sergio Zenato Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
2685,"his blend has a spicy character, balanced with acidity and a ripe, full honeyed character. On the dry side, it has richness, pepper and a deep texture that demands aging. Drink from 2017.",Heidi Schröck 2010 Ruster Ausbruch White (Burgenland)
2686,"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance of Merlot, Syrah and Malbec, is immediately accessible with notes of char, roasted coffee bean and cherry. The palate is rich, chocolaty and seamlessly stitched together.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Canoe Ridge Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
2687,"A complex wine, full of tight textures, apple skins and mineral acidity. This is a wine for aging, its wood character beautifully judged, rounding out the crisp final texture. Drink from 2016.",Damien et Romain Bouchard 2011 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis)
2688,"Rich in black cherry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors, this wine offers the firm tannins and minerality that give a young Spring Mountain Cabernet its noticeable characteristics. Give it eight years to begin to come around.",Eponymous 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
2689,"This brut-style bubbly is comprised of 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay and shows aspects of both varieties. It's fairly full bodied, with raspberry, strawberry, lime, brioche, vanilla and toast flavors. Feels elegant, complex and lush in the mouth, and should develop additional bottle notes over the next six years.",Gloria Ferrer 2005 Royal Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros)
2690,"This is a good example of the high-alcohol style of warmth and deliciousness. While it's not common for Stags Leap wines to have these characteristics, it is incredibly deep in black cherries, milk chocolate and oak, with a spicy finish that goes on for a long time, indicating the power of this Cabernet. Drink over the next six years.",Hall 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
2691,"Unexpectedly thick and mouthfilling, with generous peach aromas and flavors underscored by mustard greens and citrus. Clean and refreshing on the finish. Best Buy.",Geretto 2001 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)

2693,"Fresh and clean, with light, lemony aromas in addition to tropical fruit. The palate is textured and full, with fairly pure apple and pineapple flavors and some nuttiness. Everything works here, including the smooth, lengthy finish.  Best Buy.",La Playa 2002 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
2694,"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.",Undurraga 2001 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley)
2695,"The “least” of Lane Tanner's range of Pinots, but complex and delicious. Ripe berry and spice flavors are rich, and there's a tangy earthiness suggesting sauteed mushrooms. Very dry and crisp, with a silky texture and a long, smooth finish.",Lane Tanner 2000 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
2696,"From an emerging Mendocino appellation, an engaging, dry wine. Its mouth-cleansing acidity is fresh and clean, highlighting pretty flavors of lime and honeydew, and leads to a tart finish.",Lolonis 2001 Fumé Blanc (Redwood Valley)
2697,"Simple, delicate and fruity, a jammy style with sweetly ripe flavors of wild raspberries and strawberries, as well as espresso, tobacco and Oriental spices. It's light and silky on the palate.",River Road 2001 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
2698,"Creamy aromas of vanilla and pears also carry some typical Sauvignon Blanc pungency. For a rounder style, which it is, it's quite refreshing. The mix across the palate of banana, grapefruit and almonds is attractive, and so is the round, pretty finish. Drink it very soon.",Santa Ines 2001 Legado de Armida Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley)
2699,"Lean and angular right now, showing hints of mint and chocolate—the oak sticks out a bit over the tart cherry flavors.",Sebastiani 1996 Cherryblock Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
2700,"A good wine, grape-wise, with sharply etched, pure fruity flavors of citrus, fig and sweet tobacco. Acidity is fresh and juicy, and the wine is fully dry. Barrel fermented, it is super-oaky, maybe too much so, from the charry aromas to the woody flavors.",Signorello 2001 Seta Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
2701,"This is a full-bodied Pinot, packed with ripe cherry and strawberry flavors and framed in spicy nuance. A shade hot on the finish, ending with an unusually bright licorice and herbal edge.",Silver 2000 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
2702,"An open-knit, friendly nose features lots of nectarine and ripe apple scents. Medium-weight, with plenty of stone fruit on the palate, it finishes with a cleansing burst of peppery spice. Try as an apéritif.",Bortoluzzi 2001 Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli)
2703,"This is a great house pour for fans of Chilean Merlot with its consistent fruit, soft acidity and low tannins. On the nose and palate, a core of sweet, Red Delicious apple is accented by dry leather, toasty vanilla and dried herbs. Simple, but well crafted.",Château La Joya 2000 Estate Bottled Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
2704,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed.",Two Brothers 2001 Big Tattoo Red Red (Colchagua Valley)
2705,"Heavy and gold in color, with aromas of browned butter, wheat and corn cakes. The bouquet and color are heavy, and so is the palate: There you get oak barrel and toast, but little to no fruit. Even the finish is woody, with just a hint of melon and banana. A good experimental wine for those eager to taste oak; otherwise steer clear.",Viña Santa Monica 2001 Chardonnay (Rapel Valley)
2706,"The new clone on the block finally makes it onto the front label. Soft and silky, this wine has cherry-berry flavors with an earthy streak of tobacco and sage. There are some firm tannins that kick in on the finish, which suggest six months of aging.",Wolff 2001 Dijon Clones Selection Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
2707,"The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth. Best Buy.",Errazuriz 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley)
2708,"A rich, aromatic, honeyed style of Chardonnay, with 100% malolactic fermentation to increase the softness and sweet wood flavors. Soft peach flavors increase the tropical intensity of the wine.",Girolamo Dorigo 2000 Chardonnay (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
2709,"As easy and tasty as a summer wine gets, this blush also has a lovely coppery-pink color. Flavors of fresh strawberries and spice burst on the palate, and drink just a tad off-dry.",Iron Horse 2002 Rose de Pinot Noir Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
2710,"From a vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a young, jammy wine bursting with candied flavors of raspberries and cherries. It drinks very concentrated and intense. There's a caramelly note that may come from well-charred barrels in this dry, full-bodied wine.",Opolo 2000 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
2711,"Tasty and wonderfully drinkable. The basic flavors are cola and soy, with extra nuances of blackberries, cherries and quite a bit of smoky, sweet oak. Drinks very dry and spicy.",Savannah-Chanelle 2000 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
2712,"A taut, citrusy and minerally wine from a grape variety that's often more open and fruity, this offering is nonetheless impeccably fresh and clean, picking up some minty notes on the finish.",Merk 2001 Tocai (Friuli Aquileia)
2713,"Some earthy, herbal cranberry scents are given life by a touch of smoky oak. The palate is sweet and wholesome, and very well balanced. The finish gives a hint of syrup and oak, but the fruit is ripe and succulent enough to handle that.",Morandé 2001 Edicion Limitada - 66 Barricas Cabernet Franc (Maipo Valley)
2714,"Almost addictive with its fresh, clean flavors of sweet lemon, fig, tart green apple and cinnamon, encased in lively acidity. This zesty white wine has extra layers of complexity and depth. It's also one of the most versatile food wines around.",J Vineyards & Winery 2002 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley)
2715,"Despite the modest price, this wine needs some time in the glass or in a decanter to open up. It starts off slowly, then builds pear and quince aromas and flavors through the long, tart, minerally finish. Best Buy.",Pradio 1999 Teraje Chardonnay (Friuli Grave)
2716,"A Soave that has been partially barrel fermented is unusual, but it works in this wine, which has great concentration, roundness and softness and the complexity of toast.",Masi 2002 Colbaraca Classico  (Soave)
2717,"This luscious, balanced Pinot Grigio isn't overly complex, but scores for its cactus pear and toasted almond aromas and flavors and its peppery, refreshing finish. It's medium-bodied, with just a hint of unreleased CO2 to enliven it.",Masottina 2001 Vigneto Ai Palazzi Pinot Grigio (Piave)
2718,"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",Montes 2001 Alpha Syrah (Curicó Valley)
2719,"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality. The bouquet exudes plum, chocolate and some creaminess, while the palate bursts with blackberry, bitter chocolate and espresso. Round and satisfying, with enough structure to last a year or two—or until the next vintage comes around.",Concha y Toro 2002 Xplorador Merlot (Rapel Valley)

2721,"Made from the local Sciaccarellu grape, this is a delicious, light and perfumed wine. It has tight acidity to go with the red currant flavors and the crisp texture. The wine is poised and refreshing.",Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté 2015 Rosé (Ile de Beauté)
2722,"Lively aromas like crisp apple and white peach join more creamy, pastry-like flavors of butter, vanilla and toasted almond in this medium-bodied wine. It is soft in texture and so fruity it seems sweet on the finish.",Van Ruiten 2015 Chardonnay (Lodi)
2723,"This wine is tangy and textured with light tannins, a bite of citrus acidity and plenty of fruit. It's bright and has a juicy, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",Vignobles Bonhur 2015 Château Terres Douces Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
2724,"Largely neutral on the nose, then tangy and still fresh on the palate, this drink-now Viura is clean but unexciting. Flavors of generic citrus finish firm, with a pithy aftertaste.",Viña Otano 2014 Viura (Rioja)
2725,"Aromas suggesting honeydew melon, exotic fruit and a hint of tomato leaf lead the nose. The simple palate is a bit less expressive, offering grapefruit and a hint of white peach alongside lively acidity.",MandraRossa 2015 Urra di Mare Sauvignon (Sicilia)
2726,"Made with white vinification of Aglianico grapes, this has aromas of dried-up chamomile flower and overripe citrus fruit. The simple palate offers crushed white currant alongside zesty acidity.",Mastroberardino 2013 Neroametà Aglianico (Campania)
2727,"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.",Joseph Filippi 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley)
2728,"A pleasant mix of dark berries and fruit lead the bouquet of this friendly wine, with solid notes of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry throughout. A hint of spice adds interest to the finish, with medium-light tannins and ample acidity resulting in good overall balance.",Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pays d'Oc)

2731,"This medium-bodied wine is very fruity in aroma, and exudes ripe pear and fig flavors. Add in creamy vanilla accents and a very soft texture and the effect is almost sweet.",Tortoise Creek 2014 Jam's Blend Chardonnay (Lodi)
2732,"Dusty earth, seashell notes and tomato aromas don't fully announce how snappy, tart and racy this coastal PN is. Almost sour red-plum and pie-cherry flavors finish angular, sharp and zesty to an extreme.",Undurraga 2014 Gran Reserva Sibaris Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley)
2733,"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine.",Vermeil 2013 Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Calistoga)
2734,"Apple and citrus aromas are neither well defined nor overly aromatic. Fresh and juicy on the palate, this offers citrus peel and green melon flavors. Mild and short on the finish.",Viña Maipo 2015 Vitral Chardonnay (Chile)

2737,"Aromas of herbal red fruits, tobacco and vanilla are basic and modest. This has a wiry, acidic mouthfeel and flavors of mixed herbs, tomato, pie cherry, red plum and olive. A fresh, racy finish is tangy and tomatoey.",Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
2738,"This might be a touch volatile at first, but saucy tomato-like aromas are offset by fresh red-plum notes. A tight and tannic palate softens with time in the glass, while berry flavors carry herb and spice notes onto a lightly herbal finish.",Echeverria 2014 Reserva Merlot (Central Valley)
2739,"This is a very simple, friendly, fresh and lively white—easy to drink and enjoy with its lemony freshness. It's ideal for a party.",Famille Hauller 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
2740,"This aromatic, medium-bodied white flirts with a distinct grassiness that can overwhelm, before settling into finer notions of grapefruit and stone fruit, as well as ripe, fleshy cantaloupe.",Black Stallion 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
2741,"Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh. Flat and lazy in feel, this chunky, full-bodied number from Bío Bío tastes of baked cherry and plum fruit. A finish with low acidity and not much kick is the ending.",Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2013 Tectonia Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley)
2742,"Lively, spicy oak aromas, rich fruit flavors and a lightly tannic texture make this a well-balanced dry wine that will be great with burgers, ribs or carne asada burritos. The price can't be beat either.",Bota Box 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
2743,"Straightforward red-fruit aromas suggest cherry and plum. Rubbery, pinching tannins are the adhesive for this punchy young Rioja that tastes of raspberry and cherry and finishes steady.",Campellares 2014  Rioja

2745,"This pale-colored wine has a light, perfumed character. A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it is an attractive, bone-dry rosé, ripe with strawberry fruits, that will be best with food.",Château Léon 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
2746,"This opens with aromas that recall tropical fruit, hay and a whiff of chopped mint. The palate has weight and an almost oily texture but it lacks fruit richness, suggesting unripe pear, lemon zest and flint alongside brisk acidity.",Agricola Bellaria 2014 Oltre  (Greco di Tufo)
2747,"Aromas of black plum, black cherry, green bramble and a touch of eucalyptus precede flavors of blackberry, raspberry and red plum.",Cramele Recas 2014 Legendary Estate Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Romania)

2753,"Bland, fleshy aromas of corn and apple cider are unconvincing but not overtly negative. This feels plump and heavy, like fruit punch. Flavors of cantaloupe and citrus fruits finish yeasty, with notes of corn and white bread.",Rios de Chile 2015 Chardonnay (Central Valley)
2754,"A very drinkable, light and easy to like Merlot, this offers ripe notes of black plum, cherry and berry on the nose and mouth, with a faint hint of milk chocolate in the background. The soft mouthfeel and fruity palate finish short, but clean.",Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Merlot (Pays d'Oc)
2755,"A light, easy and cheery selection, with direct aromas and flavors of sweet cherry, red raspberry and strawberry. The mouthfeel is soft and approachable, with virtually no tannins and a clean, short finish. Drink up.",Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc)
2756,"There are a lot of uncommon, unusual elements to this Pinot. For starters, the nose is volatile, with notes of horseradish and grapefruit. The palate has a solid, juicy feel to it, while mulchy cherry and plum flavors finish aimlessly.",Loma Larga 2013 Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
2757,"This wine smells fruity, like raspberry and cranberries, and turns very tart and astringent on the palate. Sharp fruit flavors come out on the finish along with a metallic edge.",Los Portales 2013 Garnacha (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
2758,"This is herbal and ripely fruited all at once, smelling like sweet pea, carnation and baby powder combined with tones of plum and cherry. The fruity notes continue through to the medium-weight palate, though they're short-lived.",Maison Nicolas 2015 Rosé (Gard)
2759,"This light-bodied Rioja smells of cherry, plum and cotton candy. It's a bit thin on the palate but offers just enough body to be worthwhile. Mild plum and cherry flavors hollow out on the simple finish.",Montebuena 2014 Cuvée KPF  (Rioja)
2760,"Forced, candied aromas of chocolaty oak and herbal, slightly weedy berry fruits feed into a chunky, blocky, creamy palate with saucy berry flavors combined with minty, top-heavy oak. The finish tastes minty, lactic and oaky, with heat.",Montes 2014 Classic Series Merlot (Colchagua Costa)
2761,"Berry and cherry aromas register as soupy and flat. Like the nose, this feels flat, chewy and dense. Stewed, rubbery prunes and plums finish with a fig-like note and rubbery tannins.",Rayun 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
2762,"Flat, dusty aromas of lees and vanilla cookies are rather lifeless. While this is wet and somewhat juicy in feel, it's bland as a whole, with yeasty melon and citrus flavors that finish bready.",Rios de Chile 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)

2881,"From rocky estate soils, Terre Rouge's Viognier opens with delicious aromas of honeysuckle, mango and guava, lightly put together with a jolt of wet stone. Rich in mouthfeel, the finish is woodsy, like the finest herb garden.",Terre Rouge 2011 Viognier (Fiddletown)
2882,"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10–15 years, but it's a roll of the dice.",V. Sattui 2009 Paradiso Red (Napa Valley)
2883,"Give this brisk, young Pinot 5–6 years in the cellar to mellow. It's clearly a very fine wine, clean and elegantly constructed, with rich tannins and a bright squirt of acidity framing ripe cherry, currant and licorice flavors.",Westerly 2010 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
2884,"Give this lovely Pinot Noir a few hours in the decanter and serve now with your best lamb and steak entrées. It's dry, refined in the acid-tannin balance and deliciously complex, with waves of raspberries and cherries, pie crust, baking spices and toasted oak.",Whitcraft 2011 Pence Ranch Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley)
2885,"This wine is frankly high in alcohol, clocking in at 16% by volume. But it's also incredibly delicious, offering soft waves of milk chocolate, black cherry jam, red currants, bacon and black pepper. Drink this wine at night, with rich stews or barbecue, but be careful about driving.",Nicora 2010 Euphoric La Vista Vineyard Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles)
2886,"Softly tannic, rich and enormously enjoyable, this Rhône-style blend offers lush flavors of raspberries, cherries, milk chocolate, crispy bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. The alcohol is heady, but balanced with fine acidity. Drink over the next two years for freshness.",Nicora 2010 G-S-M (Paso Robles)
2887,"A block of vines set literally near a grove of Redwood trees, the 2010 Redwood's Edge is structured and slightly austere and elusive, a concentrated rendering of deep, dark red fruit, lavender and woody undertones that's incredibly delicious.",Black Kite 2010 Redwood's Edge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
2888,"Spicy and floral, with pretty cherry fruit concentrated at the core, this inviting Grenache combines grace and power. The flavors are complex and concentrated, with hints of green tea, cut tobacco, and a finishing streak of espresso and cocoa.",Bunnell 2009 Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA))
2889,"A super-rich wine, almost over the top in its honeyed intensity. It is opulent, generous, packed with ripe yellow fruits, mango and pineapple. The wine is so rich that it is hard to find the acidity, but it is there in the orange marmalade flavor right at the end.",Château la Varière 2009 Les Melleresses  (Bonnezeaux)
2890,"This wine from Château Lagrézette is powerful and dense in its own right. It has black, juicy, tar-like flavors with tannins concentrated into a dry, dark core. Blended with a small proportion of Merlot, there is just a touch of softness which will allow the wine to mature in the next 2–3 years.",Château Lagrézette 2010 Château Chevaliers Lagrézette Malbec (Cahors)
2891,"A dark, brooding wine, packed with firm tannins and solid plum-skin and licorice flavors.

2892,"This edition of Dosaggio Zero shows delicate harmony and complexity with layers of stone fruit, citrus, almond and white flower. Zesty perlage is enhanced by more stone fruit flavors on the silky finish.",Contadi Castaldi 2008 Zero Sparkling (Franciacorta)
2893,"The top wine from Domaine de Cause, it's huge, very dense and concentrated. There is a sense of extraction, showcased by the licorice and dark chocolate flavors. This needs to calm down to give the rich fruits a chance to shine. Give this wine 6–7 years.",Domaine de Cause 2009 Notre Dame de Champs Malbec (Cahors)
2894,"Reduced, floral and plummy on the nose, this is a simple, blocky, tannic young wine. Medicinal berry flavors finish loud and grapy, with a grabby, tacky feel. Fruit outweighs finesse.",Losada 2013 El Pájaro Rojo Mencía (Bierzo)
2895,"In this case, Vieilles Vignes (old vines) only means vines over 20 years. The wine is soft, rounded and full of red cherry fruitiness. Judicious wood aging has rounded the wine out while leaving all its fruit intact. It can be drunk now, but will be better from 2016.",Manuel Olivier 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits)
2896,"Aromatically appealing, it features notes of allspice, herbs, cola and cherry. The palate is lighter in style with a scrape-y feel, not fully delivering on all that the aromas have to offer.",Windy Bay 2012 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
2897,"This light-colored wine has a spicy character that points up the tannins as well as the red berry fruits. It has a light feeling, with refreshing acidity that shows strongly at the end. It's ready to drink.",Vignerons de Buxy 2012 Buissonnier  (Mercurey)
2898,"Aromas of tobacco leaf, wet soil, mature plum, resin and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers dried prune layered with notes of chocolate and grilled sage. The fleeting finish closes on a rather bitter note.",Villa Girardi 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
2899,"Yellow fruits and apple juice combine in this fresh, mineral-driven wine. It's tangy, tight with acidity while allowing room for pineapple and tropical flavors at the end. It's ready to drink but will be better in 2016.",Wines & Winemakers 2013 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Album Antão Vaz (Alentejano)
2900,"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness.",Clos La Chance 2010 Amber's Cuvee Sparkling (Santa Cruz Mountains)
2901,"Wiry cherry aromas are a touch cheesy and also medicinal. This is pinched and astringent, with a choppy mix of buttery red-berry flavors and vanilla. Like most 2008s, this finishes hard and abrupt, with staunch tannins.",Pagos del Rey 2008 Arnegui Reserva  (Rioja)
2902,"Made principally from Touriga Nacional, this is a rich wine with attractive acidity and strawberry fruitiness. It is ripe, touched with caramel and finished with wild raspberry flavors.",Quinta de Covela 2013 Covela Rosé (Minho)

2907,"This Garnacha is heavily oaked.Smoky, woody aromas come with dusty berry notes, while the palate is heavy, with cheek-smacking tannins. Flavors of hickory and roasted blackberry finish with another creamy, woody dose of oak.",Vega Sindoa 2012 El Chaparral Old Vines Garnacha (Navarra)
2908,"This toasty bottling shows some evident maturity in terms of fruit richness. It offers toasted walnut, espresso, vanilla and yellow apple-skin flavors alongside large, brisk bubbles and crisp acidity.",Il Mosnel 2010 Brut Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
2909,"One of the lesser-known of the many Mâcon appellations, Péronne is close to Clessé. The wine is smooth, ripe and fruity, with a creamed pear and lightly lemon flavor. With a hint of minerality, it could age until 2016.",Jaffelin 2013 Les Villages de Jaffelin  (Mâcon-Péronne)
2910,"From the recent appellation at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this is a light and very fruity wine with little discernible tannin or structure. Red cherries and fresh acidity dominate and the wine should be drunk young.",Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Clos des Rois Premier Cru  (Maranges)
2911,"This starts out savory and smoky on the nose, but with airing it turns murky. The palate is tight in structure, with red-fruit acidity. Flavors of cherry, raspberry and oaky vanilla turn roasted and stalky as this unwinds on a fresh-feeling finish.",Lealtanza 2011 Crianza  (Rioja)
2912,"Dust and pollen notes linger from nose to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Apple and pear flavors are a tad savory, but brightened by crisp lemon acidity. A refreshing and easy drinking wine.",Maximin Grünhäuser 2012 Herrenberg Alte Reben Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
2913,"Dusty, medicinal berry and plum aromas are open and bright. A juicy but pinched palate features narrow flavors of plum and berry skins, while the finish is rubbery in feel, with astringency as well as bright residual fruit flavors.",Aldonia 2012 Vendimia  (Rioja)
2914,"Aromas of peach blossom, citrus and a yeasty note of fresh biscuits lead the nose on this 100% Chardonnay. The palate offers walnut husk, lemon zest and a confectionary note alongside sharp acidity.",Altemasi 2010 Brut Chardonnay (Trento)

2916,"Reduced, stewy, lightly herbal aromas blend berry and tomato scents. The acidity on this five-grape blend is pointed and overriding. Flavors of herbal berry and currant are tangy but also stewy, while the finish is long and green in flavor.",Cellers Baronia del Montsant 2010 Englora Red (Montsant)
2917,"This is a fairly light, bright Pinot Noir with the marks of a ripe year and time spent in oak. It is crafted under the guidelines of a certified sustainable grape growing program. Medium-bodied and juicy, it's fairly priced and ready to enjoy now.",Benziger 2012 Appellation Series Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
2918,"Soft and ripe, this has strawberry fruit flavors, a soft texture and a warm, rich feel. There is just enough acidity to balance this really food-friendly rosé.",Herdade do Rocim 2013 Olho de Mocho Rosé (Alentejano)
2919,"Rustic aromas recall wet earth, barnyard and leather with a whiff of ripe, black fruit. The thick palate is rather muddled and delivers both sweet and bitter sensations of prune, overripe black plum, confectionary flavors, vanilla and notes of resin alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.",Le Bertarole 2010 Podere Cariano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
2920,"The pink hue is a little flat. That also applies to the palate, with the fruit showing some maturity and hinting at wood aging. It's a rounded style, full in the mouth, with ripe caramel flavors at the end. Drink now.",Poças NV Poças Pink  (Port)
2921,"Light and bright, this has a crisp prickle on the tongue, along with canned grapefruit and tight apple-skin flavors. It is almost dry, which gives the wine a mineral texture that adds a bite. Drink now.",Quintas de Melgaço 2013 QM Blue White (Vinho Verde)
2922,"A pretty, grapey wine with tones of pine and lemon underlying flavors of green plum and quince. It's flavorful, off-dry and refreshing; a good expression of Seyval Blanc.",Augusta Winery 2008 Seyval Blanc (Augusta)
2923,"A little too dry and tannic, with earthy flavors of tobacco, sage, pepper and dried leather, which only partially relieve the modest blackberries and black currants. Way too astringent all the way through.",Bella 2007 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
2924,"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.",Carmen 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley)
2925,"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec.",Pulenta Estate 2008 La Flor Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
2926,"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity. Screwcap.",Simonnet-Febvre 2007 Sauvignon de Saint-Bris  (Saint-Bris)
2927,"Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age.",Williamson Wines 2006 Clarissa Vin Rouge Red (Dry Creek Valley)
2928,"Dry, with thick tannins housing blackberry, herb and olive flavors. Drink now.",Mendocino Farms 2005 Heart Arrow Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino)
2929,"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth. This is not a concentrated wine, but there's enough acidity here to balance the slight sweetness and to make it a refreshing apéritif. Drink up.",Messina Hof 2009 Muscat Canelli (Texas)
2930,"Berry, pickle and bramble aromas are a little tough and crusted over, while the palate is snappy and fresh in feel, with flavors of herbal berry fruit and pepper. A mild hint of oak and resin dry up the finish.",Morandé 2008 Pionero Merlot (Rapel Valley)
2931,"The nose is honest and bright but not terribly expressive, with just a few delicate raspberry and cherry tones. In the mouth, bing cherry and damp earth notes takes over and continue on the medium finish. Try with a veal chop. Drink up.",La Chiripada 2007 Artist Series 1 Dolcetto (New Mexico)
2932,"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish.",Howling Moon 2008 Chardonnay (Lodi)

2934,"Basic apricot and peach aromas lead to melon, banana and pithy flavors. The palate is a little thick and mealy, while the finish has pretty good feel and length, but not much flavor. Slightly tropical and simple.",Luigi Bosca 2009 Finca la Linda Chardonnay (Luján de Cuyo)
2935,"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.",O. Fournier 2007 Urban Uco Tempranillo (Uco Valley)
2936,"A luxurious mouthfeel and good concentration are this wine's chief attractions. Flavors are more earthy than fruity, with tones of compost and stewed prunes. Medium finish shows ripe but slightly drying tannins. Drink now.",Pahrump Valley Winery 2005 Nevada Ridge First Crush Zinfandel (Nevada)
2937,"Slightly sweet, with a honeyed edge to the rich pear, apple, peach and tropical fruit flavors. Just-in-time acidity fortunately provides balance.",Sobon Estate 2008 Viognier (Amador County)
2938,"Despite some black cherry richness, there's a green, minty, stalky note of unripeness in this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre that limits its appeal. Decanting doesn't help and neither will aging.",Terre Rouge 2007 Tete-a-Tete Red (Sierra Foothills)
2939,"There is potential in this wine that bodes well for the future of Sangiovese in Virginia. The nose is charming, with mocha, fall leaves and cherries that slide into a silky palate with woodsy touches. Juicy, raspberry-inflected finish. Try with steak. Drink now.",Three Fox 2007 Il Volpe Sangiovese (Virginia)
2940,"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up.",Castello di Borghese 2006 Founder's Field Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island)
2941,"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
2942,"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.",Doña Paula 2009 Los Cardos Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
2943,"Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tart, almost sour taste. Couple that with the sizable tannins, and you have an uncomfortable wine. Call it rustic, old world. The blackberry, currant, coffee and herb flavors are fine.",Easton 2007 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
2944,"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",Gilbert Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
2945,"Readily likeable, with a nose of summer fruit soup layered over notes of field greens. The texture is lazy, with moderate acidity and almost no tannin. Try with ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce. Drink now.",Glenora 2007 Mason Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
2946,"Confected but pleasant aromas of cotton candy and sour apple drops dominate the nose, while the palate unfolds nicely with layers of lemon and red apple. Soft and lush, it picks up an apricot accent on the medium finish. Try with Thai food. Drink now.",Glenora 2008 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
2947,"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeño and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute.",Finca Sophenia 2009 Altosur Sauvignon Blanc (Tupungato)
2948,"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish.",Gilbert Cellars 2007 Estate Malbec (Wahluke Slope)
2949,"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors. There's not a lot of bright fruit or nuance, but it will ably partner simple grilled meats.",Woolundry Rd 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
2950,"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",Anam Cara 2005 Nicholas Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
2951,"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made.",Archery Summit 2004 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
2952,"A solid entry into the everyday Cabernet sweepstakes. Shows ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis and spice flavors in a smooth, polished texture whose tannins cry out for steaks and chops.",Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
2953,"Features pleasant but slightly simple flavors of candied cherries and cedar, with a smooth mouthfeel and just a hint of tannin on the finish. Drink now. Imported by Walca International.",Ceravolo 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaide Plains)
2954,"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now.",Doña Paula 2006 Los Cardos Syrah (Luján de Cuyo)
2955,"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.",Kenwood 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County)
2956,"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit. Some herbal notes persist on the palate, but this medium-bodied wine avoids the vegetal side of things, finishing fresh and clean.",Leeuwin Estate 2003 Prelude Vineyards Cabernet Merlot (Margaret River)
2957,"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now.",Parkers Estate 2005 Riverside Crossing Syrah (Sonoma County)
2958,"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish. Should hold well through 2015.",Pearson Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)
2959,"A ripe, crisp, very fresh Chablis bursting with green fruits, with a light layer of caramel and green herbs. Delicious now.",Simonnet-Febvre 2006  Chablis
2960,"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",Campos Góticos 2003 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
2961,"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines.",Frostwatch 2005 Chardonnay (Bennett Valley)
2962,"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results.",Vinos Sanz 2006 Montesol Verdejo (Rueda)
2963,"This is a blend of Inzolia and Sauvignon from a producer located high up the steep mountains above Cefalù on Sicily's western flank with cool nighttime temperature and soothing breezes. Straightforward aromas include green herb, white stone and citrus.",Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Sinestesìa White (Sicilia)
2964,"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately.",Pascual Toso 2007 Maipu Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
2965,"Shows some slightly green tomato-leaf and bell-pepper notes as well as hints of leather and hung game, but despite all that, there's also ripe cassis and chocolate flavors and a supple mouthfeel. Imported by MHW,Ltd.",Red Mud 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
2966,"From one of Sicily's most beautiful and promising vineyards, Baccante is a blend of Grillo and Chardonnay with bright clean acidity and fragrant yellow fruit. The only setback here is a matchstick aroma (not present in past years) that prevents this vintage from scoring higher.",Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Baccante White (Sicilia)
2967,"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic. Chewy and earthy, with more than a hint of seed and stem, this wine comes from biodynamically farmed grapes that add some earthy nuances, but put too much emphasis on green tea, stemmy flavors.",Archery Summit 2004 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
2968,"Earthy, soft and dry, this Zin has tobacco, cherry, blackberry and spice flavors, with an edge of sweet leather and pine. It's a refreshingly simple country-style Zin that will be nice with barbecue.",Castoro Cellars 2005 Cobble Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
2969,"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.",French Hill 2005 Grand Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills)
2970,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",Vitis Terrarum 2003 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
2971,"Seems rather oak-dominated, boasting ample brown sugar, vanilla and dill scents backed my some briary, blackberry fruit. Fills out a bit with air, so decant an hour or so prior to serving. Drink now.",Vasse River 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Margaret River)
2972,"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride.",Kaleidos 2004 Morpheus Red (Paso Robles)
2973,"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.",Lovingston 2005 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello)
2974,"With polished blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this affordable Cab represents a good value. It's soft, dry and stylish, and easy to drink.",Sonoma Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
2975,"This ripe and spicy wine from the Dop family's 27 acres offers layers of black fruits. It has a concentrated texture and a firm structure that is juicy while dense.

2976,"This Cru Bourgeois estate has produced a structured wine that is still showing strong wood-aging flavors. Toasty as well as ripely fruity, it has firm tannins and good aging potential. The aftertaste is fruity and spicy. Drink from 2019.",Château le Pey 2014  Médoc
2977,"This vineyard is at one of the highest Castillon points. Big in tannins and also fruit, this is a dense wine. It has a dry core as well as rich blackberry fruits. Concentrated and full, the wine will be seriously worth drinking from 2019.",Château Montlandrie 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
2978,"Owner Thierry Valette has been around the Right Bank (the family owned Pavie and owns Troplong Mondot) and, as a consultant, the world.

Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",Clos Puy Arnaud 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
2979,"This Alliance Bourg co-op wine is packed with minty new-wood aromas, this has the potential to be a smooth, polished wine. The blend is 70% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. Firm tannins at this stage do not mask the ripe blackberry fruits. Give this wine until 2019 before drinking.",Closerie du Bailli 2014 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
2980,"Intense notes of ripe red and baked apples make a strong impression. The palate is rich with the same baked apple along with a touch of honey and gingerbread. The yeasty flavors of autolysis provide an ideal backdrop for this structured, grown-up and classy wine. The finish is totally dry and wonderfully long.",Domaine François Schmitt NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Alsace)
2981,"You've got to like oak to appreciate this wine, which is presently dominated by scents of vanilla, mocha and toasted coconut. It's full bodied and velvety in texture, with hints of black cherry lurking in the background.",Penley Estate 2012 Special Select Shiraz (Coonawarra)

3101,"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor.

3187,"Mossy freshness and fragrance appear on the shy subdued nose. The wonderfully slender and sprightly palate is fresh and delicate. There is something subtle and lithe about this, which is very uplifting. The finish is refreshing and clean.",Lackner Tinnacher 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark)
3188,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up over 70% of this blend with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It shows aromas of dark cherries, licorice and brooding black fruit that at times seems slightly dried out. The palate shows elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",Lauren Ashton Cellars 2013 Proprietor's Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
3189,"This is quite a dynamic and layered wine, especially for the bargain price, with deep and hearty blackberry, caramel, rust, lavender and potpourri on the nose. The berry-led palate is rustic and unrefined, with feral flavors, peppery spice and decent acidity.",Now Presenting... 2014 Red (Paso Robles)
3190,"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.",On Point 2014 Christina's Cuvée Pinot Noir (North Coast)
3191,Ripe perfumed black fruits dominate this cru wine. They float above the firm tannins and concentrated acidity to offer a wine that will become rich and generous as it develops. A touch of pepper and spice adds to the layers of fruit. Drink from 2018,Pardon et Fils 2015 Les Mouilles  (Juliénas)
3192,"Spice and green pepper notes accentuate ripe luscious blackberry and cassis flavors in this classically inspired Cabernet Franc. Fine tannins and fresh cutting acidity lend vibe to the midpalate. Fleshy and ripe yet pleasantly herbaceous, it's ready to drink now but should hold well through 2022.",Paumanok 2014 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
3193,"This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice. Plan on serving it with fish or chicken rather than something rich or extravagant.",Jean-Luc Colombo 2013 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu)
3194,"This wine is big in tannin, extracted and full bodied, with dense blueberry and maple syrup at its core. For fans of a rich style, it will impress for  its ripe, dark fruit and sizable yet velvety mouthfeel.",Acacia 2013 Thornton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
3195,"This blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Cinsault would be a crowd favorite if more than 700 cases were available in the U.S. The black cherry fruit is punched up by hints of herbs and cracked pepper, there's ample weight but great freshness and zest, and the finish is long and complex, showing off hints of licorice, pepper and dusty earth. Drink now–2020.",Alain Jaume et Fils 2014 Haut de Brun Red (Côtes du Rhône)
3196,"Ripe and round, this offers enticing scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and a whiff of pressed powder. The big juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry star anise and chopped herb alongside chewy tannins.",San Carlo 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
3197,"This smooth, lean red attractively delivers above its price point. Tart in clove and currant, it finishes with a whiplash of mocha.",Sean Minor 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
3198,"A slightly earthy nose of yellow plum and stone fruit leads to a fresh textured palate, which shows off mirabelles and lemons. There is a pleasant phenolic edge and a clean, long finish.",Steininger 2015 Grand Grü Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
3199,"The dark red fruit is enveloped in the rounded, rich and chocolaty scent of oak. The palate shows a lighter side with delicate fruit of a red-cherry nature. Freshness sumptuous oak and red-cherry notes marry well. This is lovely now, but just a few more months in bottle will allow it to knit together more. Drink now through 2020.",Stift Klosterneuburg 2014 Ausstich St. Laurent (Thermenregion)
3200,A four-acre parcel of old vines is the source of this dense and rich wine. It has jammy red berry and cherry fruits that are lifted by the mineral texture and acidity. The wine is balanced although it does need to age. Drink from the end of 2017.,Terroirs et Talents 2015 Clos de la Brosse  (Saint-Amour)
3201,"Cassis, bell pepper, toast, French oak and coconut lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the tightly wound palate along with raw red currant, powdered sage, licorice and a confectionery note. Close-grained tannins leave a rather astringent finish.",Tua Rita 2013 Redigaffi Merlot (Toscana)
3202,A subdued nose leads onto a fresh easy-drinking palate that is characterized by generous spritz and ripe almost plump pear fruit that is just tempered by citrus freshness. This is so easy to drink and so refreshing with that spritz.,Unger 2015 Oberfeld Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
3203,Very varietal aromas of sour cherry and cranberry lead to a fruit-filled flavorful palate. Light oak accents linger on the finish. It's a very pleasing example of the variety.,Vino La Monarcha 2014 Sangiovese (Wahluke Slope)

3205,"Concentrated flavors and a richly tannic texture make this dry wine more sophisticated and interesting than many other red blends. It combines cranberry, black cherry and cinnamon notes for a mouthfilling and harmonious impression.",Whiplash 2015 Red (California)
3206,"With a perfumed nose of rose and toasted oak, this wine is thick in red fruit, dense oak and a welcome undercurrent of bright acidity that helps keep it fresh in the glass. Small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec are all within.",Bell 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
3207,"Inviting aromas of dark-skinned fruit, blue flower, leather and a whiff of baking spice waft out of the glass. The firm juicy palate offers ripe wild cherry, licorice and hint of charcuterie while assertive, seasoned tannins provide support. Drink through 2021.",Cerbaia 2011  Brunello di Montalcino

3210,"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",Bodegas Valdemar 2005 Inspiración  (Rioja)
3211,"Scratchy plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and forward, while the mouthfeel follows suit; it's juicy, with narrowing acidity and brightness. Flavors of raspberry, plum and cherry end zesty and long, with crisp acidity maintaining focus. This is a blend of Carignan (Mazuelo), Garnacha and Syrah.",Bula 2010 Red (Montsant)
3212,"Though not indicated on the label, once again the Morrison Lane vineyard—the oldest Syrah planting in Walla Walla—is the source of the fruit. The wine is peppery and tannic, with cherry fruit and dried herbal accents. There's a whiff of toast in the finish.",Bunchgrass 2009 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
3213,"This straightforward, perfectly clean blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha would function as a great everyday house red. It's lively and a little racy and grating on the palate, with standard, fresh berry flavors touched up by a sprinkle of chocolaty oak. A modest finish keeps the vibe positive.",Can Blau 2010 Blau Red (Montsant)
3214,Sweet peach nectar and fragrant white flower open the nose of this lush Gewürztraminer. The wine feels slightly sweet and sticky on the palate with rich density and a waxy finish.,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2011 Sanct Valentin Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)

3216,"This is a big, modern, warm Garnacha with a lot of oak and vanilla on the bouquet as well as blackberry and cassis. It's jammy on the tongue, but there's enough acidity to keep the pulse up.

3224,"With damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth. On the finish, it's full bodied and soft, with ripe black-fruit flavors that register as thick and a touch raisiny. Drink now.",Real Sitio de Ventosilla 2004 RSV 1601 El Duque de Lerma  (Ribera del Duero)
3225,"Masses of sweet blackberry jam give this Cabernet an easy deliciousness. The fruit and oak are balanced with fine tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Not one for the cellar, but it will benefit from an hour or two in the decanter.",Stryker Sonoma 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
3226,Pecorino is a fascinating white grape from Central Italy that deserves a special look. This expression bursts open with tones of acacia flower and stone fruit and delivers medium density and richness on the finish.,Talamonti 2012 Trabocchetto Pecorino (Colline Pescaresi)
3227,"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
3228,"This Rhône-style blend is fruity and delicious. It has raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into easy tannins, brightened with a bite of lime acidity. Ready to enjoy now.",The Farm Winery 2009 Touchy-Feely G-S-M (Paso Robles)

3230,"Shows the dark color, thick tannins and deep, concentrated flavors you expect from Petite Sirah. It's a big gulp of blackberry jam, espresso, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry. Lacks the acidic vibrancy needed for aging, but a fine wine to drink now.",Trueheart 2010 Truehart Vineyard Petite Sirah (Sonoma Valley)
3231,"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.",Val do Sosego 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
3232,"A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune. The blending both softens and expands the mid-palate, and seems to have boosted the aging curve. It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras.",J. Christopher 2010 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
3233,"Frankly delicious, offering wave after wave of black cherry jam, red currant, licorice, mocha, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast flavors, wrapped into soft, smooth tannins.",J. Lohr 2010 Gesture G-S-M (Paso Robles)
3234,"Rotgipfler is almost an exclusivity to Thermenregion. This bright, fruity wine is deliciously crisp with spice, pepper and pear flavors. It has a light lemon edge brought out by the refreshing acidity. Screwcap.",Johanneshof Reinisch 2012 Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)
3235,"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",Lynmar 2011 Monastery Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
3236,"The nose sends up signals of a balanced, easygoing wine with oak blended nicely into pear and apple fruit. The palate is lively and mildly oaky, with baked apple, orange and woodspice flavors. A snappy, oaky finish with intense acidity closes the show.",Matetic 2011 EQ Chardonnay (San Antonio)
3237,"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple.

3238,"This is a good value for a sophisticated Merlot from Napa Valley. It's not an ager, but it's delightful now for its dryness, smooth tannins and complex cherry and red currant flavors with hints of herbs and sweet peas.",Parcel 41 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley)

3241,"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc (77%) and Sémillon, this wine comes from three separate vineyards in the Columbia Valley.

3242,"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green, reedy aromas along with notes of cranberry and cherry Jolly Rancher. The full-bodied palate delivers more but seems disconnected with tart, tangy cranberry flavors.",Cana's Feast 2013 Northridge Vineyard Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA))
3243,"Aromas of toast, oak, espresso and a whiff of smoke lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, coconut, coffee and vanilla but there's not enough fruit richness to support the oak. It's already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later.",Cantine Leonardo Da Vinci 2010 Da Vinci Riserva  (Chianti)
3244,"A stamp of smoke and toasted oak mark the entry into this wine, followed by chewy tannins that wrap themselves around dark layers of chocolate and tobacco leaf, the structure at first impenetrable. The finish is relaxed and somewhat short.",Hill Family Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
3245,"This lightly colored wine blends Grenache (43%), Syrah (32%) and Mourvèdre. It brings aromas of red raspberries, currant and flowers. The palate is fresh and lighter in style, with the emphasis on fruit.",James Wyatt 2013 Untamed Cuvée Red (Yakima Valley)

3247,"This tradition-bucking blend of 61% Chenin Blanc, 31% Viognier and 8% Roussanne offers soft aromas of sweet apple blossoms and peach, with a hint of barrel smoke. The palate offers a similar blend of peaches, pears and apples, warmed up with some oak influence.",Vinum 2013 White Elephant White (California)
3248,"Aromas of toast, milk chocolate and black-skinned fruit lead the way. The soft, low-acid palate doles out crushed plum, fleshy cherry and mocha alongside drying, angular tannins that create an abrupt finish.",Viticoltori Senesi Aretini 2009 Riserva  (Chianti)
3249,"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine. It smells like cinnamon and cedar, tastes slightly sweet and smoky, is full bodied and rich in texture. Nice and smooth, it shows only mild varietal character.",Wise Villa 2013 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Placer County)
3250,"This is a substantial wine, concentrated in dark red berry color and flavor, from cherry to wild strawberry to more savory rhubarb compote. Muted on the nose, it has an underlying woody, herbal character that balances the vibrancy of the fruit.",MacPhail 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
3251,"If only this wine wasn't extracted so much (which gives bitterness), it would be ripe and fruity. As it is, it's hard to get past the tight, dry tannins. There are hints of juiciness and black currant fruits. It might soften by 2016.",Maison Bouey 2012 Château Lestruelle  (Médoc)
3252,"This crisp, fruity wine has delicious acidity. Gray-pink in color, it is ripe with red berries that also impart attractive freshness. The wine is crisp, tangy and textured at the end.",Maison Bouey 2014 Le Rosé Gourmand de Lestruelle Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)

3254,"Flavors of berry, vanilla and tar form around thick, rich tannins, giving this wine a puckering quality that may benefit from opening before enjoying. The finish is sturdy and robust in leathery black pepper.",Rosenblum 2012 Winemaker Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County)

3256,"This 100% Merlot offers a lot of heat around its otherwise approachable lift of soft, smooth tannins and reasonable oak. Sage, cedar and tobacco provide a weedy aspect to the wine, offset by plenty of ripe blackberry and cherry.",Hanaiali'i 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley)
3257,"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation. It's tart and full in feel, not seeming entirely varietally correct.",Lagana 2013 Breezy Slope Vineyard Pinot Noir (Walla Walla Valley (WA))

It's not very complex, but perfect for summer barbecues or car camping.",Loft 2013 Merlot (Monterey)

3269,"This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mélange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish.",St. Supéry 2014 Estate Grown Moscato (Napa Valley)
3270,"This is a traditional style—emphasizing earthy tannins and spicy fruit and is rough around the edges—but is a wine that would relish being partnered with sausages, salamis and hard cheeses. There is plenty of weight, the acidity coming from minerality and wood.",Clos de Gamot 2002 Cuvée des Vignes Centenaires Malbec (Cahors)
3271,"Not many wines come from Bucelas today, as its vineyards get eaten up by the northern Lisbon suburbs.

Dry and clean, it shows California rosé near its best.",Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Rosé (Edna Valley)
3277,"This blend is mainly Shiraz (50%) and Grenache (28%), which accounts for the wine's ample, plummy fruit flavors.

Drink now-2012.",Turkey Flat 2005 The Turk Shiraz-Grenache-Cabernet-Mourvèdre Red (Barossa Valley)

3284,"Rubbery and smoky at first, with leather and berry fruit running secondary to the wine's more reduced qualities. But if given ten minutes to unwind, it shows wide black-fruit flavors, creaminess and finally some barrel-based resin. Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as “oaky.”",Melipal 2006 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza)
3285,"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins.",Morrison Lane 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
3286,"Picked late and fermented on native yeast, this Viognier brings some snap and spice to its scents and flavors.

3289,"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish.",Adamant Cellars 2006 Spofford Station Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
3290,"The bouquet here is very floral and intense: you'll get jasmine, honeysuckle, sweet apple, mango and other exotic fruits. The wine tastes clean, sweet and dense and has fragrant flavors that accompany you glass after glass.",Alberto Longo 2007 Le Fossette Falanghina (Puglia)
3291,"Another super Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well Lake County does with this variety. It's all about the citrus, fig and spicy melon flavors and the juicy acidity, which makes the wine so fresh and clean. Made from the Musqué clone.",X 2006 ES Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
3292,"Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure.",Godwin 2005 Floral Clone Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
3293,"A fresh, intriguing wine whose balance and depth suggest midterm aging. Golden in color, it's succulent in the flavors of peaches, pineapples, limes, almond biscotti and butterscotch, with fine acidity and a rich, honeyed finish. Give it until sometime in 2008 and for another couple of years.",Hagafen 2006 Ripken Vineyard Roussanne (Lodi)
3294,"The second wine from Malhadinha Nova is lively and fruity, packed with red fruits, sweet strawberry flavors and easy, ripe texture. Drink now.",Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2006 Monte da Peceguina Red (Alentejano)
3295,"With the '05, Bucklin is getting a handle on this old-vine field blend of two dozen varieties, which seems to do best in cooler years. It's a rustic-chic wine, with a brawny muscularity tamed by extreme dryness, and even though the alcohol is 15.6%, it doesn't feel too hot.",Bucklin 2005 Old Hill Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
3296,"Soft and fruity, this Bordeaux blend has a splash of Syrah. It's dry and grippy in tannins, and there's a dried herb edge to the blackberry fruit. Finishes polished and elegant, but the softness suggests early drinking.",Corley 2004 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oak Knoll District)
3297,"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now.",DFJ Vinhos 2004 Tinta Roriz and Merlot Red (Estremadura)
3298,"Fresh green-apple aromas and some ripe, mango flavors, this is well rounded, showing some acidity, but more of open, fresh fruits. This is a wine that will be perfect to drink over the next few months.",DFJ Vinhos 2006 Monte Alentejano White (Alentejano)
3299,"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",El Nido 2003 Clio Monastrell-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Jumilla)
3300,"The wines of Backsberg have a distinctive, artistic quality to them that makes them ideal for collectors and drinkers who seek wines with style. This Pinotage has those qualities, with its layers of cinnamon and deep berry on the nose and smooth, integrated berry and smoke flavors. This is a real Pinotage so expect the rubbery smoke that goes along with it—but it's also elegant, offering structure and complexity with a gentle touch.",Backsberg 2005 Pinotage (Coastal Region)
3301,"The grapes were grown on the Central Coast, mostly in Arroyo Grande, and the wine is characterized by vibrant acidity. There is an intense taste of raspberries, more usually found in a red variety like Grenache than a white wine, but Grenache Blanc consitutes nearly half the blend, along with Roussanne.",Bonny Doon 2005 Le Cigar Blanc White (California)
3302,"This one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.",Codorníu NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Cava)
3303,"Thanks to its buoyant aromas of field flower, green apple, pear and dried sage leaf, you could definitely describe this as a multidimensional wine with noticeable elegance. There are musky, sweet fruit flavors on the finish.",Conte Collalto NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene)
3304,"Schug's regular Pinot, as opposed to their Heritage Reserve, is a dependably village-style expression of easy-drinking, cool-climate Pinot Noir. The '06, like previous vintages, shows a silky, delicate texture framing cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a smoky vanilla edge of oak.",Schug 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
3305,"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it.",St. Clement 2004 Star Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
3306,"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009.",Arbios 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
3307,"This is a dry Prosecco, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut or extra dry. Traditionally, Prosecco has this level of sugar, making it a very true rendition of what the wine is intended to taste like: Fresh peach, basil, pineapple, yellow apple and even an understated touch of banana come into play.",Adami NV Vigneto Giardino Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
3308,"One of the principle grapes of the Alentejo, Antão Vaz blends easily with the Arinto of neighboring Ribatejo. There is an attractive citrus element to this wood-aged wine, soft, open, but remaining fresh, the tropical fruit flavors well under control.",Alentex 2006 Antão Vaz-Arinto White (Alentejo)
3309,"The idea here is to present a more structured and sophisticated Brut with emphasis on the nutty tones and mature peach. The wine succeeds in this regard but the whole point of Prosecco is to be light and fun; this ultimately lacks those sharp, well-defined fruit tones you might expect.",Bortolomiol 2005 Brut Millesimato Motus Vitae  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
3310,"Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral. Yellow apple and chalk are immediately recognizable. The mouthfeel is creamy and foamy with fresh crispness that is noticeable but not exaggerated.",Bortolotti NV Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
3311,"There's a sweetmeat, salty leatheriness to this Pinot, like beef jerky. Give it a year or so to mellow out and let the smoky oak integrate with the ripe cherry, cola and raspberry flavors. Decant for an hour or two if you pop it open now.",Castle 2005 Sangiacomo Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros)
3312,"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.",Codorníu NV Reserva Raventós Brut Sparkling (Cava)
3313,"A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans.",Ortman Family 2008 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
3314,"Year after year, the Yasmin line from Recanati proves itself to be a fantastic value, and the 2009s are no exception. This 60% Merlot-40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is fruit-driven but appropriately spiced with a lovely mocha-infused finish. The silky texture offers approachable, dusty tannins integrated throughout the medium-weight mouth.",Recanati 2009 Yasmin Kosher Red Red (Galilee)
3315,"Perfect for a pairing with lasagna or meat cannelloni with bechamel sauce, this bright Chianti Classico has the natural acidity to cut though fatty food ingredients. The wine's aromas recall white cherry and raspberry.",Tenuta di Vignole 2007  Chianti Classico
3316,"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.",Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
3317,"Teeters on the verge of complexity, with dry, spicy flavors of raspberries and cherries. Good Carneros acidity makes for a brisk mouthfeel. Should develop for a year or three in the bottle.",X 2009 Truchard Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
3318,"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.",Albet I Noya 2009 Petit Albet White (Penedès)
3319,"Avignonesi takes a traditionalists' approach to most of its wines, including this ruby-colored Rosso di Montepulciano. Slightly muddled aromas of cherry and dried raspberry mingle with tobacco, leather and spice.",Avignonesi 2008  Rosso di Montepulciano
3320,"Here's a fresh and lively unoaked Chard that's perfect for lighter fare like tabouleh salad or grilled chicken. Green apple and citrus mingle with a hint of lemon custard on the nose, while the medium-weight mouth offers more green plum and white nectarine flavors. Flavorful and refreshing; drink now.",Binyamina 2009 Reserve Unoaked Kosher Chardonnay (Judean Hills)
3321,"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",Valserrano 2004  Rioja
3322,"A plump, nicely concentrated Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Mount Beautiful doesn't have the most intense aromatics, but is holding on to its weighty melon and fig flavors and lingering citrus finish. Drink up.",Mt. Beautiful 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Canterbury)
3323,"Sangiovese is enhanced by small percentages of Malvasia Nera and Colorino to deliver a plush, plump and satisfying Morellino from southern Tuscany. There's a nice feeling of informality here that makes this wine perfect for easy meals with family and friends.",Poggio Nardone 2008  Morellino di Scansano
3324,"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character.",Château Ramafort 2008  Médoc
3325,"Slightly more concentrated than other Marlborough Pinots in this price range, the 2008 Mana displays modest cherry fruit and an array of savory elements, including game, brine and peppery spice. It's a bit rough around the edges, yet in a charming sort of way. Drink now–2012.",Mana 2008 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
3326,"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir. It's as if the raspberry and cherry wine has been enlivened with a splash or three of lime juice. This primary fruit tartness may be because the wine was bottled and rushed to market too early. Don't drink it now. Give it a year or two to integrate.",Drew 2009 Morning Dew Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
3327,"Clove and dark Indian spice is the protagonist here and background aromas of cherry and moist earth play supporting roles. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with a bright, zesty close.",Giuliano Tiberi 2007 Le Vespe Sangiovese (Toscana)
3328,"Made from an unknown blend of grapes, this nonvintage red is good, dry and versatile. It has juicy flavors of blackberries and pepper, with some extra layers of depth that make it a good value for a restaurant by-the-glass wine.",Greater Purpose NV White Label Red (Dry Creek Valley)
3329,"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Reina de Castilla 2009 Isabelino Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)
3330,"This is a classic interpretation of Chianti Classico with bright aromas of small berry fruit, raspberry and blue flower. But there's also a modern touch as well that comes off aromatically as spice and new leather.",Rocca delle Macìe 2007  Chianti Classico
3331,"This wine is missing great depth of flavor. It has bright acidity and hints of peach fruit flavors, but remains dull.",Joseph Drouhin 2012  Pouilly-Fuissé
3332,"There's pineapple and sharp dill on the nose of this wine from a Gilroy-based producer. Once sipped, apple cider and a tinge of petrol flavors emerge.",Vino Vargas 2013 Olé Chardonnay (Central Coast)
3333,"This is a generous, rounded and very perfumed wine. Candy and bubble gum flavors give sweetness that contrasts with the acidity.",Demessey 2012 Château de Messey Les Crets  (Mâcon-Chardonnay)
3334,"Faithful to its label, this zero-degree residual-sugar Riesling is stark, steely and intensely dry. Bracing lemon acidity and tart green-apple flavors lend a tight, unyielding feel to the palate, but it's a refreshing accompaniment to creamy pasta or chicken dishes. Drink now.",Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 0 Degree Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake)
3335,"The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end.",Joseph Drouhin 2011  Chorey-lès-Beaune
3336,"Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosé. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate.",Knapp 2013 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes)
3337,"Funky aromas of farmyard, tire rubber and fetid flowers waft from the glass of this Nero d'Avola. The muddled palate offers stewed prune, overripe black plum and oaky vanilla alongside bitter, green sensations of old sage. Panebianco, Vinity.",Armosa 2008 Curma Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
3338,"Aromas of pressed apple and pear are savory and earthy on this brisk, medium-bodied Grüner Veltliner. There's a dusty minerality that lingers through the midpalate, but the finish is bright and lemony.",Fulkerson 2012 William Vigne Grüner Veltliner (Seneca Lake)
3339,"Pleasant and fruity to sip, soft in texture, light- to medium bodied, it has a rich yellow-gold color, butter-candy aromas, ripe apple flavors and a slightly sweet finish.",Stomping Ground 2012 Chardonnay (California)
3340,"This blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah is a chunky, slightly rustic style of Côtes-du-Rhône. It starts off with tar and herb aromas, then turns plummy and chocolaty on the palate. Drink now–2017.",L. Tramier & Fils 2012 Linteau Red (Côtes du Rhône)
3341,"Peach and apple aromas are fruity but not precise or minerally. This has peachy acidity but a wide, unfocused palate. Flavors of peach and nectarine are tasty but lack the crispness that Albariño is known for.",Lo Nuevo 2012 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas)
3342,"This tight wine has red fruit acidity without the richness. With its green edge, it's likely to remain full of acidity even as it matures.",Pierre André 2011  Ladoix
3343,"Made of Kinali Yapincak, a grape native to Turkey, this deep-straw colored wine does not give up much on the nose beyond a touch of apricot and just-washed cotton sheets. It does not seem wholly integrated on the palate, with chewy tannins overpowering flavors of melon, toast and white flower.",Suvla 2012 Kinali Yapincak (Thrace)
3344,Pressed apple notes are touched with butter and creamed corn on this savory-style Chardonnay. It's rich and full on the palate with a satisfying silkiness that's brightened with lemony acidity.,Swedish Hill 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
3345,"The green fruit flavors dominate this very fresh, crisp wine. It has acidity as much as fruitiness, giving a steely, tight character. Drink now.",Chanson Père et Fils 2012  Viré-Clessé
3346,Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.,Coto de Hayas 2013 Chardonnay (Campo de Borja)
3347,"A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged.",Demessey 2011 Les Hâtes  (Santenay)
3348,"Tropical in character, this wine has soft acidity and an attractive texture. With ripe mango flavor, it's full in the mouth and ready to drink.",Jean-Marie Challand 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Viré-Clessé)
3349,"Burnt caramel aromas give a wine that has weight, sweetness and packs in the vanilla. It misses out on real fruitiness, giving weight rather than freshness.",Domaine Sophie Cinier 2012  Mâcon-Fuissé
3350,"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way.",Fazeli Cellars 2009 Khayyam Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley)
3351,"Lush and tropical with rich, ripe streaks of pineapple and mango, this medium-sweet Riesling is unabashedly forward and fruity, but hints of earth and dust on the midpalate lend a dark tone. Light on its feet, with a lemony finish.",Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 2nd Degree Medium Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes)

3355,"While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate. Bold in body and alcohol, it's rich with red fruit, but has a musty, earthen tone that persists through the finish.",King's Garden Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)

3359,"Gritty, intense, oaky and powerful from start to finish, this displays black-fruit aromas, hints of asphalt and an intense mouthfeel with a tight grip.

3361,"This hails from a 1,000–1,400-foot elevation site above the valley floor called Oakville Ranch that contributes beautiful power in its firm, integrated tannin and oak. Balanced, the wine exudes lovely notes of boysenberry tart, blackberry and cedar, with a dusting of clove.",Sojourn 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
3362,"This is a rich, peppery and generously tannic and full-bodied expression of the grape, both powerful and brimming in grace.

3363,"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5–8 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering.",Thorn Clarke 2014 Eden Trail Riesling (Eden Valley)
3364,"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality.

3366,"Subtle, well-balanced and rich in texture, this full-bodied wine sneaks up on the taste buds, starting with mild Bosc pear and toasted-almond aromas, then pouring richer pear, honey and hazelnut flavors onto the palate. A slight reserve in the flavors is more than offset by a quiet complexity and lingering finish.",Spicy Vines 2014 Joie de Vivre Chardonnay (Mendocino Ridge)

3368,"Planted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the country. Jason Lett showcases this special fruit in this natural wine with no sulfites added and no cold stabilization. Light gold in color, the crisp apple flavors are forward, the balance is spot on and the finish polished. Drink now through 2020.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Original Vines Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)
3369,"In this inaugural release, winemaker James MacPhail travels to the far reaches of Annapolis to source grapes from the true wilderness, the site next door to Goldrock Ridge Vineyard.

3370,"This bone-dry and floral wine will taste great with simple appetizers like toasted nuts or fresh cheeses. It is very well concentrated and has medium to full body. An opulent texture helps carry the floral, appley, grapefruity flavors into the finish.",Uvaggio 2015 Secco Moscato (Lodi)
3371,"A slightly bitter tobacco note frames black-cherry fruit. The tannins need more time to smooth out, and that bitter streak is a bit worrisome. But that said, this powerful deep compact wine may explode with flavor if you have the patience to cellar it. Drink after 2020.",WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Triple Black Slopes Pinot Noir
3372,"This thoroughly delightful wine puts a polished sheen on this grape, that is so often lost in the shuffle between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay.

3375,"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine wins over fans by its brains rather than its brawn.

The flavors are fresh and layered, bringing a sense of vibrancy and deliciousness.",Avennia 2014 Arnaut Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
3376,"From century-old vines, this wine is potent and focused, with powerful, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels polished and precise.

Best after 2021.",Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Solesce Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

3381,"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese.

A bite of lemon-lime acidity offsets all the opulence, lending edge to a long, lingering finish.",Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
3382,"Layers of exotic spice and crushed earth permeate through this dry Riesling paying just homage to it's red-clay origins in Ürziger Würzgarten, the spice garden of the Mosel. It's exquisitely light bodied, a revitalizing crush of cutting white grapefruit and lime flavors. The finish is marked by a meandering spray of spice and honey. Drinks well now but should improve through at least 2030.",Dr. Loosen 2012 Ürziger Würzgarten GG Réserve Alte Reben Erste Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel)
3383,"Big and bold in character, this full-bodied and abundantly tannic wine looks black to the rim and smells like pencil shavings, leather and wood smoke.

3385,"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty.

3390,"Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly. There's not a lot of vitality to the palate, while tangerine and nectarine flavors are watery. Pithy citrus notes carry the finish before it putters out.",Vicente Gandia 2014 Hoya de Cadenas Organic Verdejo (Spain)
3391,"Tropical aromas revolve around lemon-lime. This is acidic without much body. Flavors of lemon, melon, mango and green apple are lean and finish with tangy, pithy citrus flavors.",Casa Montes 2014 Ampakama Chardonnay (San Juan)
3392,"Bland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish.",Albet I Noya 2014 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès)
3393,"From the producer's Old Vineyard Block, and blended with 20% Petite Sirah and 5% Syrah, this wine has a rustic barnyardy quality. It offers a tightness of dried herb around broad, sweet tannins, strawberry jam and chocolate.",Gustafson Family 2012 Mountain Cuvée Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)

3396,"Leafy, green aromas suggest eucalyptus and a briar patch. A lean palate offers aroma-matching flavors of green herbs along with plum, cherry and clay notes. This is oaky and resiny tasting on the finish, and hot as well.",Angulo Innocenti 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (La Consulta)
3397,"This is on the light side, with simple flavors and a juicy, soft texture that shows very little tannin. Aromas and flavors recall cherries and strawberries.",Cable Car 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)

3410,"Yeasty aromas are devoid of fruit, commitment and minerality, and instead smell oddly floral and unconvincing. A waxy, wan palate and oaky flavors of clove finish with resiny, pushy spice notes. This tastes overly oaky and resiny, like the winery's Rioja white called La Capellanía but without the goods.",Pazo de Barrantes 2012 La Comtesse Albariño (Rías Baixas)
3411,"The wine is fruity, although with a yeasty character that leaves a bready taste. It has acidity, ripe yellow fruits and the fruitiness may come to dominate although that is not certain.",Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz 2014 Monsaraz Branco White (Alentejo)

3420,Rustic aromas are followed by rough-edged fruitiness in this young wine. It has ripe berry fruits as well as some firm tannins in the background. It is not yet integrated and needs to develop much more. Drink from 2018.,Quinta de Porrais 2012 Porrais Red (Douro)
3421,"This light, bright wine comes from the north of the Vinho Verde region. It has freshly squeezed lemon juice with a touch of lime zest as well as spice. The lightest prickle on the tongue gives the wine a final lift.",Quintas de Melgaço 2014 QM Terra Antiga White (Vinho Verde)
3422,"Chunky, slightly jammy plum and blackberry aromas are good but basic. In the mouth, this shows tartaric grit and bite along with lean fruit. Flavors of red plum and raspberry finish zesty but with hardly any complexity.",Tricky Rabbit 2012 Reserva Cabernet Franc-Carmenère (Maule Valley)
3423,"This wine also contains 25% Zinfandel and is wildly savage in herb, baked plum jam, tobacco and a strong arm of oak. Midpalate, it takes on more savory peppercorn and herb over fruit, finishing mildly.",Bradford Mountain 2012 Grist Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)

3429,"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice.

George Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)

The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
3434,"Jammy plum and berry aromas come with dessert herb scents. A juicy palate doesn't offer much structure, but this Monastrell-Syrah blend tastes good courtesy of plum, blackberry and toasty flavors. The ripe warm finish is generous.",Chopo 2014 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)

3437,"Hibiscus and strawberry scents make an appealing invitation on the nose of this bottling, and then light cola and pepper spice up the ante. This would be a great red for warmer weather, served with a slight chill that would still allow the flavors of sandalwood, red cherry and marjoram to emerge.",MooBuzz 2015 G-S-M (Central Coast)
3438,"Though a reserve bottling, this shows a very fresh and sprightly side of the grape rather than its dense face. Squeezed blackberries, just-picked thyme and a touch of burnt caramel show on the nose, while the palate offers Concord grape, boysenberry and iced-coffee flavors.",Opolo 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)

3446,"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest. Hard cherry candy carries a touch of rubber, and some rugged tannins. That said, it's got plenty of punch and power.",Roco 2014 Gravel Road Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
3447,"Earthy nose of dried underbrush, truffle and scorched soil give way to cranberry and sour cherry flavors. Dried herb and dark spice add some depth while tightly packed astringent tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish.

3448,"A blend of 85% Nebbiolo and 15% Uva Rara, this fragrant red boasts alluring scents of pressed rose, moist earth, aromatic herb and whiff of exotic spice.

3457,"Odd aromas of curried meat and iodine are more unusual than off-putting. This feels a bit wide and heavy, with flatness to the palate. Flavors of roasted plum and savory spices suggest lamb curry, while this feels robust and aggressive on a slightly hot finish.",Cadus 2014 Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza)

3469,"Rather tough and gritty now, this bone dry wine offers herb, tobacco and cedar flavors, with suggestions of cherries and currants.

3470,"Cheerful and bright, this well-priced wine offers a great introduction to Barbaresco to those who might be less familiar with this noble Italian wine.

3476,"A dry, spicy wine, with some good dense tannins. There is some power here, the dark fruits hinting at sweetness, but this is followed by the high acidity typical of the vintage. It should all come together in a year to 18 months.",Château Couhins-Lurton 2007  Pessac-Léognan
3477,"There is plenty of wood, both in aromas and to taste. What is worrying is the dominance of the wood over the relatively light fruit character. There are just hints of Cabernet black currants, but then the wood closes in. It needs 3–4 years to come together.",Château Fonréaud 2007  Listrac-Médoc

3496,"Vacillates between seeming totally fresh and clean and showing herbal, light green notes. There's graham cracker, jammy blackberry and bergamot on the nose, but also a pickled element.

3607,"Riverbench's regular estate Pinot Noir, as opposed to their excellent Mesa reserve, has struggled over the years, and this '09 continues that pattern.

3608,"The label doesn't tell you, but this is from the Firestone family's Curtis Winery vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley. It's a very nice wine, especially at this price.

It has a chewy, plush feel in the mouth with bright freshness on the close.",Lamborghini 2005 Campoleone Red (Umbria)

3651,"Here's a big, rich, densely layered Syrah, the kind of wine that Cab or Merlot lovers who are looking for alternatives should discover.

3653,"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",Forefathers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
3654,"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.",Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)
3655,"Bridlewood has crafted a very serious Syrah, from a region of Santa Barbara County that excels at this Rhône variety. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with rich, dense tannins, but what's notable is the depth of flavor. The blackberries, currants, licorice, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors are very rich. Drink now and for a few years.",Bridlewood 2004 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)

3658,"Rich in red currant, cassis, licorice, cola, vanilla cream and smoky oak flavors, with a smoothly tannic texture, this wine seems to be Cabernet-based.

3659,"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins.

It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.",Soos Creek 2005 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
3660,"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure.

3661,"The blend is classic Bordeaux—85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.",Pepper Bridge 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
3662,"Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel.

3664,"This has so much raw, rough oak flavor when first opened that the fruit is nearly invisible.

Give this plenty of breathing time.",Righteous 2008 Righteous Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA))

3668,"Made from Cab Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, this is a very flavorful wine, with rich blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors. But it's very sharp in acidity, with a jalapeño pepper burn that limits its appeal.",Happy Canyon Vineyard 2009 Chukker Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)

3673,"Opens with a mix of toast and dusty, herbal aromas, and with time it turns more saucy than precisely fruity. A bulky wine with a chunky mouthfeel and fleshy flavors of herbal plum. A late wave of tartness and more herbal flavors cements things into place.",Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)

3679,"This seems to be an attempt at an Italianate style, with modest alcohol levels (11%) and the accompanying lack of fruit expression. It's largely neutral, with hints of underripe pear and white pepper that combine with chalky notes on the finish.",Jacob's Creek 2009 Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia)
3680,"“The Affair” refers to the relationship between the French and Italian varieties in the blend. Sadly, this isn't the hottest affair, with the strong game, red currant, strawberry hull, milk chocolate and smoky dried salami notes all downplayed by the lean mouth and waxy finish.",La Vierge 2008 Temptation The Affair Red (Walker Bay)
3681,"Not disappointing given the price. There's some toast and tropical fruit on the nose, and then pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity runs a bit sharp, but overall this is a reasonable, warm-climate, tropical Chard for the money.",Luis Felipe Edwards 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
3682,"Immediate aromas of chalk and peach waft up from the glass, followed by flavors of green lime and asparagus in the round mouth.

3688,"Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry.",Small Vines 2012 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)

3690,"Soft and full-bodied, this offers bright apple and citrus fruits layered with toast from wood aging.

3692,"Oaky, heavily roasted aromas of hickory, baking spices, coconut and exotic black-fruit scents feed into a chunky but easygoing palate with spicy, barrel-rich flavors of hickory and vanilla as well as baked berry and leather. A ripe, slightly rubbery finish is generous. Drink through 2018.",Alto Moncayo 2010 Veraton Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
3693,"Already showing some toasty maturity, this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir is delicate, yeasty and rounded.

3698,"Blanc de Noirs, white Champagne only from red grapes, produces wines with some weight, as here.

The fruitiness gains shape from a zesty texture.",Tendil & Lombardi NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne)
3699,"This is an elegant Champagne, with a burgeoning sense of maturity as well as fresh acidity. Flavors of ripe pear are cut with a light touch of lemon while the overall texture is soft and on the sweet side of Brut.

3824,"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush. Believe it or not, this is actually drinkable now, yet should age easily through at least 2025.",Jean-Luc Colombo 2009 Les Ruchets  (Cornas)
3825,"Sure, it starts out a bit toasty and cedary, but that wood will surely integrate with the potent plummy, meaty fruit given a few years' time. It's full bodied and a bit coarsely textured for the moment, but finishes long and will clearly benefit from cellaring. Drink 2018–2025.",Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Saint Pierre  (Cornas)
3826,"This shows floral and underbrush aromas of violet, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate offers ripe black cherry, red currant, Asian spice and toasted notes. It's structured yet elegant, with firm but fine tannins and nice depth. It's ready now, so enjoy soon.",Villa S. Anna 2009  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
3827,"This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean. But it also has a solid core of ripe oranges and limes. It's fine to drink now, and could even develop mushroomy bottle complexity over the next six years.",Testarossa 2010 Brosseau Vineyard Chardonnay (Chalone)
3828,"Awesomely rich in black cherries, plums, licorice, mocha, cola and sweet oak flavors. Made from selected barrels of the winery's various vineyards around the state, its richness is balanced by brisk acidity and a soft scour of tannins. Drink over the next six years.",Testarossa 2010 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California)
3829,"Mango aromas drive this rich wine, full of honey as well as spicy fruits. It is not so much weighty as intense, with a sense of warmth. Now mature and ready to drink, it still retains a youthful fruit character.",Louis Sipp 2008 Osterberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
3830,"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious.",San Giusto a Rentennano 2010  Chianti Classico
3831,"Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8–12 years.",Black Coyote 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
3832,"This is perfectly balanced dry Chenin. It has just the right amount of richness, aided by a touch of vanilla. The green and white fruits are blended with deceptively soft acidity to give a wine that feels full and ripe in the mouth. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 3–4 years and more. Screwcap.",Domaine des Baumard 2010  Savennières
3833,"Mango aromas and flavors give a sense of the sweetness of the wine. It is rich and full bodied, with spice and pepper notes just hinting at acidity. Keep the wine for 3–5 years.",Domaine Ehrhart 2010 Brand Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
3834,"The name is an oblique reference to Shiraz, which forms the basis of this cuvée. It's inky in hue and rather reticent on the nose at first. But swirl it vigorously and be rewarded with layers of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Full bodied, rich and tannic, its blueberry and cassis fruit lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2015–2025.",Domaine de Fondrèche 2009 Persia Red (Ventoux)
3835,"Here's a classically crafted selection, with a lovely floral and earthy fragrance. The palate shows dark-plum and black-cherry flavors laced with white pepper, mint and balsamic accents. While it has tame acidity, it's still tightly wound and needs just a few years to soften and develop additional complexity; drink after 2015. Vi Wines, J & J Importers.",Antico Colle 2010  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
3836,VV refers to the old vines that are at the heart of this impressive wine. It has great concentration both from the richly structured fruit and tannins. New wood comes through richly on this powerhouse of texture and density. Give the wine at least six years to mature.,Wine & Soul 2010 Quinta da Manoella VV Red (Douro)
3837,"Floral and black fruit aromas are punctuated by spicy notes on the nose of this wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black-cherry, white pepper, mint and sage along with big but ripe tannins and edgy acidity. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2015–2020.",Istine 2010  Chianti Classico
3838,"An opulent feeling Riesling, full of peach and pineapple flavors. It's ripe, full in the mouth and textured, its richness masking the dryness of the fruit and the acidity. It could age a few more years—give it 2–4.",Joseph Fritsch 2010 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
3839,"Retro makes one of the best, most consistent Petite Sirahs in California. Even though they used to source their fruit from Howell Mountain and this bottling now is from Pope Valley and Calistoga, it still shows the same qualities of complex interest based on impeccable winemaking. It's an amazing wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with a complex range of berries, currants, herbs and white pepper. Truly a Petite Sirah for Cabernet lovers. Drink now–2020.",Retro 2009 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
3840,"This Pinot Noir is from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, near Annapolis, north of the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. It shows its origin in the brisk acidity and delicacy of mouthfeel, as well as the fantastic range of wild red berry, cola, pine, nettle and white pepper flavors that change from second to second. New oak brings toasty, vanilla complexities and wood tannins. This is a delicious wine now, but will age gracefully for at least eight years.",Sojourn 2011 Ridgetop Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
3841,"Ikon refers to Touriga Nacional's position as Portugal's iconic grape. It is almost black in color, and profoundly dense and dry with wood tannins at this early stage of development. Yet it promises a palate that's rich and smooth with fruit in time. It's intended for long-term aging so drink from 2017.",Fiuza 2011 Ikon Touriga Nacional (Tejo)
3842,"A lovely, wine, with aromas of red cherry, violet and hints of underbrush. The palate delivers succulent wild cherry, cinnamon and natural vanilla flavors with hint of truffle. It has compelling depth but needs time to tame the structured yet elegant tannins. Drink 2016–2025.",Bibbiano 2010  Chianti Classico
3843,"This is a smooth, impressively rich wine powered by silky tannins and ripe black fruits. The palate is intensely concentrated with a big, bold structure and a solid feel. It does need some aging, so drink from 2016.",Wines & Winemakers 2009 Aguia Moura em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro)
3844,"This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The mouthwatering palate shows concentrated wild-cherry flavor layered with mint, white pepper and clove. It has fresh acidity and firm tannins that will develop complexity with more bottle age. A textbook Chianti Classico.",Castellinuzza e Piuca 2010  Chianti Classico
3845,"Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.",Domaine Schoffit 2009 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
3846,"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering. Oak shows up in this equation as sweet buttered toast. Altogether, it's a complex, elegant, delicious wine that will develop bottle bouquet over the next 10 years.",Gary Farrell 2011 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
3847,"Calidonio is a fascinating and deeply layered wine that is remarkable off the bat thanks to its unique personality and compelling aromatic profile. Piedirosso (85%) is fermented in oak with 15% Aglianico to create tones of black fruit, spicy smoked meat, resin and black licorice. It is smooth and very soft on the close.",Ocone 2008 Calidonio Red (Taburno)
3848,"Vintner Salvatore Geraci is the proud producer of Palari Faro, one of the great red wines to emerge from the Mediterranean rim and the island of Sicily. The elegance and finesse is extraordinary and the wine opens with a complex bouquet that sees petite elements of cassis, licorice, tar and tobacco rolled into one.",Palari 2007  Faro
3849,"Quite a good Cabernet, virgorous and dry, with an earthy edge of sweet, dried herbs alongside the blackberries and cedar. More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there.",Round Pond 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
3850,"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm, this plump, creamy-textured spätlese displays ample minerality—there's a distinctly slate-driven note—allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this would be terrific with slightly sweet or spicy dishes.",S.A. Prüm 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
3851,"Spicy and assertive, this young, cellar-worthy Pinot Noir just hints at the complexity within. Give it plenty of air time and it opens aromatically with allspice, sandalwood, perhaps some cola and pine needle. The tart and tangy berry fruit is still compact and primary, but fully ripe and nicely sculpted into a well-defined wine from start to finish.",Archery Summit 2008 Arcus Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
3852,"Old vines, at least 60 years old, are the basis for this soft, wood-aged wine. The texture is smooth, with rounded tannins and density. Flavors include licorice, bittersweet chocolate and black cherries.",Bernard Baudry 2009 Les Grézeaux  (Chinon)

3854,"A wine that combines the richness of the vintage with the extreme flinty texture of young, dry Chenin Blanc. Packed with ripe acidity, it is pure, very crisp, yet for aging.",Château d'Epire 2009 Cuvée Spéciale  (Savennières)
3855,"Made in a ripe, soft style that's unusual for Howell Mountain, this Zin could almost be Grenache, or even a big Pinot Noir. The cherry pie filling, raspberry cream and Dr. Pepper flavors are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's a luxurious, exotic Zinfandel whose heat from high alcohol adds a spicy element.",Dark Matter 2006 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
3856,"Hails from Macul, so it exhibits some normal eucalyptus on the nose along with spice and pointed, slightly piercing berry aromas. The palate is chewy, sweet, modern and ripe, with chunky berry, herb, olive and particularly graphite flavors. Settles on big black fruit and depth. Outstanding Chilean Cabernet with individuality. Best from 2013-2016.",Domus Aurea 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
3857,"A huge wine, explosive in ripe fruit, elaborated with rich oak and wrapped into smooth, sweet tannins. Made from vineyards throughout the county, it dazzles with a complex of blackberry jam, mocha, date, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors. Really impressive, especially at this price. Drink Now–2015.",Rusack 2008 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
3858,"This Pinot Noir needs a few years in the cellar to mellow, although you can decant it now to let it breathe. It's very rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and sweet, smoky oak, with a soft, silky texture. Shows a real sense of sophistication.",Thomas Fogarty 2008 Windy Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
3859,"A distinguished Cabernet whose superb tannins, which are firm and ripe and refined, testify to its Napa origins. So does the blackberry and currant fruit, which finishes in a swirl of sweet, smoky cedar wood. Good as it is, it's way too young. Should be best around 2015 and afterward.",Tudal 2008 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
3860,"This interesting wine is an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties with nearly half Syrah. It does what Napa does so well, offering a plethora of ripe, delicious cherry, black raspberry, dark chocolate, sweetly smoked oak and peppery spice flavors that are deep and long on the finish. A lovely, accessible wine to drink over the next few years.",Viader 2008 Estate Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley)
3861,"A great Viognier, rich and exotic, showing the powerful fruit you want from this variety, in a balanced, elegant way.

Rita Hills)
3862,"From 29-year-old Pinot Nero vines, Pinéro is an elegant and fine still red wine produced by one of Italy's most celebrated sparkling wine houses. Polished and finessed down to the smallest detail (those tiny berry aromas come forth so clearly), this wine shows the potential of the Burgundian variety in Italy.",Ca' del Bosco 2006 Pinéro Pinot Nero (Sebino)
3863,Classic. Beautiful acidity is balanced by just a touch of sweetness. The wine is bright with apple and lime flavors.,Domaine Huët 2010 Le Haut-Lieu Sec  (Vouvray)
3864,"Very young, needs plenty of time. Still showing fermentation notes, with brisk, grapey acidity and primary cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Seems brilliantly constructed and capable of aging, though. Hold until after 2012.",Donelan 2009 Walker Vine Hill Syrah (Russian River Valley)
3865,"The combination of very high alcohol and what tastes like residual sugar gives this Grenache an excessively sweet, glyceriney taste. It's fabulously rich in raspberry cream, blackberry jam, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Very flamboyant and delicious, but really more of a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",Beckmen 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley)
3866,"A field blend ice wine—don't see that very often—it's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruits—tropical, stone fruits and citrus. Concentrated and poised, it balances on fresh acidity. Just a hint of plastic in the back of the finish.",Viento 2009 Underwood Mountain Vineyards 55% Riesling/45% Gewurztraminer Ice Wine Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR))

3868,"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a négociant's blend, is really delicious. It's rich, dry, tannic and lush in blackberry and cherry tart, chocolate and smoky cedar flavors.",Wine Spots 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
3869,"The best Clos Pegase Sauvignon Blanc in years. Made with a little oak, just enough for creaminess, it's marked by vibrant acidity and complex, lovely flavors of lemongrass, Meyer lemon candy, vanilla, white pepper and the distinct minerality that Carneros white wines often display. Great price for a wine this sophisticated.",Clos Pegase 2009 Mitsuko's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros)
3870,"A finely crafted wine, its tight acidity generating a very fresh profile. There is an intensity of fruit as well as a mineral texture. For aging. Screwcap.",Domaine des Baumard 2007 Clos de Saint-Yves  (Savennières)
3871,"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.",Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2009 Berncasteler Doctor Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
3872,"A real bruiser of a Zinfandel, dark in color, dry and tannic, brimming with massive flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pie spices. The tannins are hard, in the way of this mountain. Drink Now–2013 before it loses fresh fruit.",Elyse 2007 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
3873,"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss.",Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon)
3874,"Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle.",Lachini 2008 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
3875,"Named for a beautifully restored castle and boutique hotel in Abruzzo, this beautiful Italian white (made with Trebbiano grapes) shows a delicious creamy texture with abundant aromas of stone fruit, honey and toasted almond. The wine is thick and textured on the close.",Masciarelli 2007 Castello di Semivicoli  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo)
3876,"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.",Castle Rock 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
3877,"Somewhat hard-edged wine, showing the sharpness of young Chenin Blanc. It has a future, though, as this edge drops away, because there is some good weight as well as bright fresh final acidity. Keep for several months.",Château Moncontour NV Brut Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Crémant de Loire)
3878,"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.",Derbes 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros)
3879,"With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol. But it's strong in those perfumed pyrazines that turn some people off.",Frog's Leap 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
3880,"Juicy and extracted, with bright jam tones and an open-knit structure. There's plenty of berry fruit here and a nice plum tone to the palate that carries over to the fleeting finish. A good choice for a big crowd.",Hellbent 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
3881,"At 2.3% residual sugar, this is nicely balanced between sweet and dry. The fruit links peach, apricot and pear with a honey in tea streak that carries into the finish.",Washington Hills 2008 Riesling (Washington)

3885,"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous.

A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia.",Las Colinas Del Ebro 2008 Syrah-Grenache (Terra Alta)
3886,"A solid value, the Marquee Victoria Chardonnay has an appealing restraint, hitting pretty high notes on the nose but turning serious and weighty in the mouth. The cream and papaya flavors reach a nice intensity before fading to a mouthwatering finish of guava and pine nuts. Drink now.",Marquee 2008 Classic Chardonnay (Victoria)
3887,"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now.",Anciano 2003 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
3888,"As with the Avery Lane Merlot, this is a rather complex blend, here including Syrah, Cab Franc and Lemberger. Fruity and spicy, with strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Very pleasing picnic wine.",Avery Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)
3889,"A nice, rich Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with lots of different kinds of foods. With some new oak, it has fruity-sweet flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots and lemongrass, with a tang of gooseberry.",Beltane Ranch 2009 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
3890,"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Bodegas Docampo 2008 Viña do Campo White (Ribeiro)
3891,"A fresh-faced wine, bright with berry fruits, a light layer of tannins and a soft, easy texture. There is some stalkiness but this is great as a delicious, easy wine.",Cortes de Cima 2009 Chaminé Red (Alentejano)

3895,"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",El Burro 2008 Kickass Garnacha (Cariñena)
3896,"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.",Enkidu 2006 Fazekas Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
3897,"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors.

With its assertive tannins, it should stand up well to a grilled tri-tip.",Plaisance Ranch 2013 Ranch Red (Applegate Valley)
3922,"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar. It is fresh with red berry acidity and some perfumed tannins. It should be ready to drink soon, but wait until the end of 2016 for the best results.",Quinta do Cavalinho 2013 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo)
3923,"Leather saddle wafts from the glass atop ripe cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar. Tightly wound in tannin and oak, this wine becomes pleasantly juicy on the finish.",Rodney Strong 2013 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
3924,"The nose is a bit shy but reveals delicate scents of citrus and a whiff of peach blossom while the vibrant palate displays crisp apple, tangerine and a hint of steely mineral. Brisk acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish.",Ronco Blanchis 2014 Ribolla Gialla (Collio)
3925,"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate.",Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Santa Clara Valley)
3926,"Delicate but alluring scents of spring flower and orchard fruit lift out of the glass. The palate is linear and rather lean but still refreshing, offering pear, yellow apple and mineral alongside bracing acidity. It closes crisp and clean.",St. Pauls 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
3927,"Fresh and lively, this opens with aromas of jasmine, tropical fruit and a whiff of flint. The vibrant palate offers crunchy Granny Smith and candied lemon alongside brisk acidity. A mineral note energizes the crisp finish.",Tenuta di Angoris 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
3928,"This is a thick, rich and very ripe wine, with a charred back note making its way against higher-toned tastes of red raspberry and blackberry. The oak is integrated and the wine softly varietal, but it packs a punch on the palate.",Buena Vista 2013 Attila's Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
3929,"Sharp, prickly aromas suggest tart red plum and wild herbs. The palate is a bit heavy and sticky, with sweet, gummy, medicinal berry flavors. Finishes bitter and peppery, with a medicinal aftertaste.",Don Cristobal 1492 2010 1492 Red (Mendoza)
3930,"Tomato leaf, rhubarb and herbal aromas come in front of a tight, tannic and prickly palate with green, spicy berry flavors. Turns hot and smacky on the finish, with carob and herbal flavors.",Finca El Origen 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
3931,"Pretty good for the price, with jammy cherry, berry, cocoa and spice flavors. An easy Zin to drink with BBQ or pasta with tomato sauce.",Glen Ellen 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (California)
3932,"A heavy, sweet Zin. With 16% alcohol, it tastes like a simple Port, with raisin, blackberry and chocolate flavors.",Manzanita Creek 2005 Carreras Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
3933,"Salinic and minerally on the nose, with a hint of peach. The palate is wet and light, however the flavors run stalky and tart, with green banana and bitterness leading to a chalky finish. Quaffable.",Montepio 2010 Pinot Gris (San Juan)
3934,"Red plum, tomato and brambly herbal aromas set up a snappy, astringent palate with strained raspberry, spice and herbal flavors. Very dry and acidic as it transitions to the finish. An herbal, sharp-edged red.",Notro 2010 Tinto Fundación Red (Mendoza)
3935,"Salmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon. Sweet on the palate, with weight and thickness along with cantaloupe and a candied aftertaste. Finishes chunky and flat; tasted twice with inconsistent findings. This note reflects the better bottle.",Ochoa 2010 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)
3936,"Overtly sweet, with a white sugar edge to the citrus fruits, this is basically a dessert wine. Earns extra credit for cleanness and crisp acidity.",Robert Mondavi 2010 Pinot Grigio (California)
3937,It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.,Starmont 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
3938,"Light red wine, with a stalky black currant character. It is very fruity, showing herbs and soft tannins. Almost an apéritif red, certainly one for lightly flavored dishes.",Aveleda 2010 Casal Garcia Tinto Red (Portuguese Table Wine)
3939,"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre is unbalanced. It's sweet in dessert red berry fruit, with an awkward streak of acidity.",Brophy Clark 2009 G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley)
3940,"Sweet and syrupy smelling, with maple-covered doughnut and muddled spice and tree bark aromas. The palate is more cutting and acidic than expected, with a sheer mouthfeel and heavy vanilla and oak flavors covering up underdeveloped red fruit notes. Hard, crisp and tannic stuff.",Caligiore 2008 Organic Legacy Old Vines Malbec (Mendoza)
3941,"Heavy and stalky smelling, with burnt aromas. The leaden palate is weighty and short on freshness; tastes pithy and stalky, with some nectarine and plum thrown in. Seems to be fading.",Caligiore 2010 Pianissimo Rosé (Mendoza)
3942,"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down.",Cedar Mountain 2007 Hansen Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
3943,"Simple and sweet, with jammy pineapple, orange and apricot flavors leading to a soft, honeyed finish.",Concannon 2010 Selected Vineyards Chardonnay (Central Coast)

3945,"A soft Vinho Verde, with white fruit flavors, only light acidity and some final sweetness. An attractive apéritif.",Wines & Winemakers 2010 Clemens Reserva White (Vinho Verde)
3946,"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor.",Cosentino 2008 The Novelist Meritage (California)
3947,"Earthy and tealike, with those attributes framed by charred, nutty oak. It's supple enough to be balanced for immediate consumption.",De Bortoli 2009 Deen De Bortoli Vat 10 Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia)

3951,"Smells earthy and leathery, with a grilled meat element to the nose. The palate runs sharp and high in acid, with narrow plum flavors. Doesn't offer a whole lot on the finish. More rubbery and tart than ideal.",Pasaje Alto 2010 Andes Crossing Malbec (Mendoza)
3952,"Herbal and green peppercornish, with dark berry flavors and herbal-vegetal notes. Light and crisp; complex for the price.",De Bortoli 2008 DB Family Selection Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
3953,"Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet. It's a chunky, heavy wine with thick, jammy plum flavors that have strong herbal undertones. Warm, grabby and baked on the finish, which is plodding.",Figaro 2009 Tinto Red (Calatayud)
3954,"This is a less formal Vin Santo. The wine is creamy and thick, with sweet syrupy notes of chestnut, honey, maple, candied fruit and dried apricot.",Fattoria di Casalbosco 2006 500ml  (Vin Santo del Chianti)
3955,"Dominated by its dry tannins, this is a tight black currant and dark plum skin-flavored wine, surrounded by a firm core of tannins, a firm and dark-hued wine.",Georges Duboeuf 2009 Clos des Garands  (Fleurie)
3956,"There is great structure here, with dusty tannins percolating through the rich wine. It has power, concentration and density, with cocoa and cherry flavors well integrated. Think about aging for 1–2 years.",Georges Duboeuf 2009 Sélection  (Moulin-à-Vent)
3957,"This weirdly named wine is a blend of 95% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. It's a bit soft and melted in texture, like liquid licorice, with flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, anise and smoky oak, and the finish is dry. Notable for the elegance and purity of its tannin structure.",Jarvis 2008 Will Jarvis' Science Project Red (Napa Valley)
3958,"Big, dark and brash, and very much in the modern California style, meaning it's rich, creamy, oaky and full-bodied. The nose brings toast, heat and potency, while the flavors are saturated, spicy and revolve around wild berry, tea, spice, caramel and savory warmth. Only gets better as it opens and airs; drink now through 2012.",Kingston Family 2008 Alazan CJ's Barrel Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
3959,"Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.",Lapostolle 2007 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
3960,"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.",Syncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA))
3961,"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop.",Trapiche 2008 Broquel Bonarda (Mendoza)

3963,"A solid, dense wine, packed with tannins and with a dry core. The soft fruit has flavors of strawberry, hinting at richness to come. At this early stage, tannins and acidity are still forming. Hold for five years.",Louis Latour 2008 Les Beaumonts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée)
3964,"There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4–5 years.",Louis Latour 2008 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
3965,"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.",M by Michael Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
3966,"A Châteauneuf-du-Pape-style Rhône blend that really nails it for satisfaction. Rich and fruity, spicy, yet with great structure. Defines the vintner's art of blending, comprised of five varieties sourced from a dozen vineyards. Fun and serious at the same time.",Margerum 2007 M5 Red (Santa Barbara County)
3967,"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now.",Pedroncelli 2007 Family Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
3968,"This 60-40 blend of Trebbiano Toscano and Malvasia Bianca offers a traditional interpretation with thick sweetness and aromas of roasted chestnut, caramel and honey.",Pietro Beconcini 1999 Caratello  (Vin Santo del Chianti)
3969,"This is a robust and firmly structured Syrah with medium-coarse tannins and medium-full weight. Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish. Though it's intense, it still feels like it's holding back a little bit; try after 2012 for a more forward presentation.",Boekenhoutskloof 2007 Syrah (Coastal Region)
3970,"The Cartizze cru is known as the best area for growing quality grapes for Prosecco. This precious expression shows drying mineral tones backed by sweet fruit, melon and peach. The soft, creamy quality if the perlage is also noteworthy.",Bortolotti NV Cartizze Dry  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze)
3971,"Big, structured and solid, with powerful dense fruit, this is packed with plum juice flavors. The wine feels chunky, while the acidity keeps everything in proportion.",Chanson Père et Fils 2007  Gevrey-Chambertin
3972,"With hints of mint, and a firm structure from wood as well as tannins, this is a flattering wine. The tannins are rich, layered within the jammy black berry fruits. This is a wine for aging, but is deceptively attractive now.",Château Cambon la Pelouse 2008  Haut-Médoc
3973,"Since the futures tasting in 2009, the wood element has been tamed. It is still an important factor, but the fruit has blossomed, showing a solid core of tannins, surrounded by dark plum and red fruit flavors. It will need many years, but everything is here now.",Château Lilian Ladouys 2008  Saint-Estèphe
3974,"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ‘05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.",Corison 2006 Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
3975,"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well. It's flavorful in citrus fruits, peaches, golden mangoes and honey, yet balanced with racy acidity. The dry, crisp finish makes it an ideal cocktail sipper.",Longboard 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
3976,"If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now.",Margerum 2007 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
3977,"Inky dark in appearance and concentration, this muscular Recioto della Valpolicella Classico wraps your tongue tight with its blockbuster power and persistency. Aromas include blackberry jelly, chocolate, cola and exotic spice. It finishes with smooth firmness and loads of personality.",Nicolis 2006 500ml  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico)
3978,"A pleasant wine that shows a sweet, spicy apricot nose; on the palate it has an interesting smokiness that works well with the fruit, and although there is a fair amount of alcohol, the fruit just manages to cover it, and the wine moves to a pleasant if not particularly long finish.",Giacomo Ascheri 2006 Cristina Ascheri  (Gavi di Gavi)
3979,"A lightweight Sauvignon Blanc that fits the standard Marlborough profile, with slightly grassy notes layered over grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Drink now.",Saint Clair 2007 Vicar's Choice Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
3980,"Light and fruity with pineapple, melon and apple. This fruit forward, food-friendly wine has natural acids and a delicate balance. For the money it is a fine choice to accompany seafood, poultry and pasta salads.",Covey Run 2005 Quail Series Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
3981,"A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish.",Bearboat 2004 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
3982,"Thickly textured and rather sweet, with superripe apples and pears that at times seem almost drenched in honey. Probably best on its own, well-chilled as a hot-weather apéritif.",Spy Valley 2006 Pinot Gris (Marlborough)
3983,"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Grüner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character. The toast character doesn't quite work either.",Jurtschitsch 2006 Schenkenbichl Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
3984,"The Valdinara is a soft, seductive wine showing plenty of jammy fruit, and a pleasant smoky spice. On the finish it is a touch stemmy, but it is so slight that it adds an exotic edge to the wine. Pleasant, not very intense and easy to like.",Valdinera 2005  Barbera d'Alba Superiore
3985,"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.",X 2005 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
3986,"The Ratti proved to be a rich, pleasant, gentle wine, showing lots of plummy fruit, not much acidity and a medium finish. The wine will marry well with a variety of foods, thanks to its hefty texture and its easygoing personality.",Renato Ratti 2004 Villa Pattono Red (Monferrato)
3987,"Chiarlo tends to be one of the more reliable producers in Piedmont, and this comes across as a pleasant everyday wine. The fruit is very ripe, bordering on the superripe; but on the palate, the wine has some interesting flavors, dark cherry fruit and hints of licorice and green olive.",Michele Chiarlo 2005 Le Monache Red (Monferrato)
3988,"The Pertinace offers a a soft, spicy nose of blackberry jam, vanilla and cinnamon. A pleasant, everyday, food-friendly wine that can be drunk now but has the structure to improve for a year or so. Imported by MW Imports.",Pertinace 2006  Dolcetto d'Alba
3989,"The Pertinace evolved nicely in the glass; at first there are simple lime peel aromas, but over time, they become richer and slightly more complex. On the palate there is pear, as well as the lime and an interesting smoky quality. Crisp and with good balance, the finish is a little short. Imported by MW Imports.",Pertinace 2006  Roero Arneis
3990,"The Einaudi is a fairly hefty version of a Dolcetto, having lost some fruit but gaining an interesting earthy character to the palate. Structurally a little on the chunkier side, but with good concentration. The finish is solid but dominated by the earthiness. Should be drunk soon.",Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2004  Dolcetto di Dogliani
3991,"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?",Seia 2005 Alder Creek Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)
3992,"This Rhône blend is soft and sugary sweet, with a honeyed, vanilla fudge and smoky oak edge. The underlying wine flavors are of peaches, pineapples and yellow apricots.",Kindred 2005 Marsanne-Roussanne-Viognier White (Russian River Valley)
3993,"Like its vintage predecessors, this seems to have some residual sugar, which gives a honeyed sweetness to the peach, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. But it has a very crisp, pleasant acidity that keeps the wine lively.",Maddalena 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles)
3994,"Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper.",Beringer 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
3995,"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.",Familia Schroeder 2006 Deseado Torrontés (Neuquén)
3996,"Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them. In contrast, the palate is almost pushy–this is a big, fat intense wine. Essentially quite simple, but very tasty. Short to medium finish.",Il Falchetto 2006 Tenuta Del Fant  (Moscato d'Asti)
3997,"Flighty and delicate on the palate, this refreshingly mineral semi-sweet wine is juicy with sweet apple flavor accented with brisk lime acidity. Hints of honey  and white flowers linger softly on the finish.",Red Newt Cellars 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyards North Block Riesling (Finger Lakes)
3998,"Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up. The wine is lively, tough and offers bracing acidity. Flavors of herbs, licorice and lemony acidity support core blackberry fruit, while the finish is herbal and woodsy, with dark notes of espresso and black licorice.",Señorío de Caleruega 2009  Ribera del Duero
3999,"Delicate lavender and herb notes perfume this pretty off-dry wine. It's delicate in profile, but flavors of tart yellow stone fruit and blossom gain intensity on the palate with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. It concludes with a refreshing mineral tone.",Silver Thread 2012 Semi-dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
4000,Minerally black plum and boysenberry aromas set up a rubbery palate with medium weight and intensity. Generic but happy flavors of blackberry and cassis finish with dry spice and rubbery notes  as well as length and freshness.,Telmo Rodríguez 2012 g Dehesa Gago  (Toro)
4001,"Precise yellow grapefruit, currant bud and apricot notes lead onto the medium-bodied, zesty palate. The grapefruit note remains dominant on the palate, and the lively acids give it a vibrant edge.",Breaux 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Virginia)
4002,"Aromas of brick dust, tobacco, red flowers and cassis come with a touch of herbal green scents. This feels healthy and balanced, with flavors of herbal berry and currant. Things turn a bit saucy and more herbal on the finish.",Chakras 2009 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
4003,"Nicely dry and tart in acidity, this pretty wine is fine to drink now. Flavors recall citrus fruits with richer notes of papayas, along with gooseberries and green mint from cool-climate grapes. Made without the malolactic fermentation, the wine was coopered in 55% French oak.",Chalk Hill 2012 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill)
4004,"A fruity wine, it shows ripe red berries, red currants and refreshing acidity. So while the wine has weight, it is also totally fresh and crisp. It's a rosé for food, rich while balanced.",Château Henri Bonnaud 2013 Terre Promise Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)

4008,"Roughly half stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc and half barrel-fermented Sémillon, this has noticeable sweetness that puts a sugary edge on the flavors. Pineapple and Meyer lemon fruits are round and full-bodied. This should be chilled to cut down some of the sugary flavors.",Covington 2012 Klipsun Vineyard Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Red Mountain)
4009,"Fresh floral and apple notes are showered with zesty lime and lemon on the nose of this bright, invigorating wine. Dry and medium-bodied in style, the palate boasts hints of freshly cut grass and green apples that lend an herbaceous touch to concentrated grapefruit flavors.",Dr. Konstantin Frank 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes)
4010,"A savory wine, it features aromas of lemon zest, stone fruit and hazelnuts. The palate offers lemon-lime, pear and pink grapefruit accented with mineral and an almond note.",Fattoria La Rivolta 2012 Greco (Sannio)
4011,"Bright, playful berry and plum aromas are clean and fruity. Fresh and juicy, it shows firm but not jagged acidity. Flavors of ripe plum, berry, cocoa powder and herbs finish in forward fashion and not too oaky.",Argento 2012 Bonarda (Mendoza)
4012,"There's a lush, decadent edge to this wine, thanks to heady aromas of vanilla cream, chocolate-covered raspberry and boysenberry preserves.

4014,"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later.",Ken Wright 2011 Celilo Chardonnay (Washington)
4015,"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",Kim Crawford 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
4016,"Dusty, yeasty aromas of red apple skins, cherry and chocolate lead to a solid and true palate with a good bubble bead, moderate elegance and full flavors of plum, red apple, cherry and spice. This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish.",Llopart 2010 Brut Reserva Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
4017,"This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk.",Maimai 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay)
4018,"Polished and sleek, this wine opens with tropical fruit and citrus aromas. The steely palate offers grapefruit, lemon zest and nectarine alongside energizing mineral and fresh acidity. It has a clean, refreshing finish.",Masseria Felicia 2012 Anthologia Falanghina (Falerno del Massico)

4020,"From a vineyard in the Green Valley, it has ripe flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, pears and Meyer lemons, with lots of smoky, honeyed notes of new French oak. Not very subtle, it will appeal to fans of oaky, ripe Chardonnay.",Nickel & Nickel 2012 Stiling Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
4021,"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",Niner 2010 Fog Catcher Red (Paso Robles)
4022,"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh.",Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
4023,"With minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping.

Bright aromas of lime, white melon and apple carry through to the brisk, well-balanced palate, with faint hints of hay and ginger-like spice on the close. Drink now.",Raats Family 2012 Original Unwooded Chenin Blanc (Coastal Region)
4025,"Sultry, smoky oak accents the ripe fruit core, full of apricot, peach and pear aromas and flavors.

Drink now–2016.",Radford Dale 2012 The Renaissance of Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
4026,"It begins with aromas of mature tree fruit and spring flowers. The palate delivers a wave of Bartlett pear, peach, yellow apple, nectarine and mineral accented with hints of aromatic herbs and supported by fresh acidity.",Sanpaolo 2012  Greco di Tufo

4554,"This is edgy and lean, with mulch and latex on a stripped back nose. In the mouth, it clangs around due to racy acidity. Flavors of leafy red fruits and citrus are not fully convincing.",William Cole 2011 Albamar Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)

4557,"With dusty, candied aromas, the bouquet on this semisweet Cava is scattered all over the map.

4568,"Aromas of steeped prune and raspberry jam mix with a note of used leather and chopped herb.

The fruit has almost dried up completely so drink sooner rather than later.",Illuminati Dino 2010 Pieluni Riserva  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane)
4569,"Damp earthy berry aromas are a touch murky. This feels bulky, grabby and tannic, while overriding flavors of coffee, toast and bitter chocolate make fruit a bit player. A choppy finish with hard tannins and herbal berry flavors puts this Cabernet in the midtier category.",Viñalba 2014 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Valle de Uco)

4588,"One of the most cutting, acid-intense Albariños out there. The nose in minerally and tight as a drum, with green melon and green apple scents.

4591,"A bit thin and acidic, but charming for its dryness and firm tannins, which call for rich, marbled beef. The pepper-inspired blackberry and cassis flavors are fine. Not an ager, but will benefit from a few hours of decanting.",Ridge 2008 York Creek Zinfandel (California)
4592,"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine is currently hard, astringent and oaky, with caramel, vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors.

4597,"In the past, Allegrini adopted a vocal stand against Ripasso (a middle ground wine between Amarone and Valpolicella) and for this reason Corte Giara Ripasso comes as a big surprise. Despite the controversy, this historic producer presents a very acceptable wine with pretty tones of sweet spice and bright berry.",Allegrini 2008 Corte Giara  (Valpolicella Ripasso)
4598,"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012.",Arger-Martucci 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
4599,"This 100% Viognier shows the variety's exotic side, with delicious tropical fruit, citrus, pear, melon, lychee and smoky oak flavors. It's a bit one-dimensional, but appeals for its fresh acids and richness.",Arrowood 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley)
4600,"Hints of smoke and wet stone combine with sweet Granny Smith apple and stonefruit aromas on the nose of this inviting dry Riesling.

4601,"Though richly perfumed with rose petals and elderflower, the flowery aromatics are reined in by bright lemon and citrus peel notes. The palate is plush and rich with flavors evocative of earl grey tea served with rose petal jam, with a gentle acidity to keep things fresh.",Atwater 2008 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
4602,"The components of this wine are all over the place, with blackberry and currant fruit, 100% new oak, brisk tannins and acidity needing to come together for harmony. Whether or not they will is a guess. Right now it's rustic, but dry and complex enough to drink after a good decant.",Autonom 2007 Law of Proportions Syrah (California)
4603,"Quite good and rich in jammy berry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, but there's a certain obvious appeal that lacks complexity, and it's not what you expect from a wine of this reputation and price. This bottling has been falling off from the glories of the 1990s for some years now. A pity. Hopefully the trend will reverse. Production was 9,008 cases.",Beringer 2007 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
4604,"Rubbery and roasted, but not too much so. Otherwise one should look for medicinal berry aromas followed by flavors of baked plum, prune and black pepper. The finish is dense, a touch flat, and chocolaty; overall this is a chunky, sweet performer.",Bodegas Tarima 2009 Monastrell (Jumilla)
4605,"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is another example of the fine values coming out of the Costières de Nîmes.

Drink it over the next 2–3 years.",Château Grande Cassagne 2008 Grenache-Syrah (Costières de Nîmes)
4606,"A highly aromatic wine. Lychee is the prime scent along with white flowers, and the palate is oily but right, with lychee, ginger, spice and orange flavors. Plump but short on the finish, but clean as a whole. Very nice for Chilean Gewürz.",Cono Sur 2009 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley)
4607,"A drying mineral note of slate or graphite runs through the middle of this plush and rich red Ripassato wine from Valpolicella. Background notes of spice and cherry cola come through as well, especially in the mouth where the wine boats a soft, compact feel. Pair this wine with lamb or light beef dishes.",Corteforte 2007 Podere Bertarole Ripassato  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)

It's easy, crisp mouthfeel washes clean over the palate.",Degani 2008 Cicilio  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)

4612,"Yellow-gold in color, with baked fruit, butterscotch, creamed corn and wood resin aromas. Forcefully oaked and massive in the mouth, with enough sporty acidity to prop up the woodspice, nutmeg and resiny flavors that render the fruit secondary. Much like chewing on an oak plank, structured and layered.",Finca Allende 2008 Blanco White (Rioja)
4613,"Slightly fiery and hot on the nose, but there's enough berry, cherry and dusty leather to keep it positive. The palate is more sheer and sharp than expected, with piercing raspberry, razor's edge acidity and only a touch of back-end sweetness. Juicy but short and searing.",Genium Celler 2006 Ecològic Red (Priorat)
4614,"This late-release Riesling from Seneca Lake wafts with the delicate perfume of sweet peas, ripe stonefruits and a petrol undertone.

4615,"Dry and refreshing with clean, pure notes of white peach, orange blossoms and petrol on the nose and palate, this shows off Riesling's pristine side.

4616,"A lively, surprising bargain made from Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. That it costs merely $8 makes the melon and apple aromas and flavors all the better.

4617,"Amarone Capitel de' Roari delivers a crisp, lean expression that showcases Valpolicella winemaking tradition.

4618,"New leather, pressed rose, violet, baking spice and crushed herb are just some of the aromas you'll find in this textbook Barolo.

4619,"Quite light in color, the aromas bring initially locked up but then broadly expansive notes of peat, green olive, white pepper, strawberry, Stargazer lilies, mineral and herb, showing a lot of complexity. The palate is textured, bringing a profound mixture of fruit and savory flavors that intertwine effortlessly on the long finish. It brings a sense of tension, texture and finesse that is completely captivating.",No Girls 2014 La Paciencia Vineyard Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
4620,"Hearty aromas of black cherry and mulberry meet with rustic iron, dark spice, crushed slate and dried sagebrush on the expertly woven nose of this bottling by a Southern California-based vintner.

4623,"The 2014 Coleraine is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc. Some herbal, cabbagey notes blow off with air to reveal vanilla, cedar, cassis, blackberry and mocha.

4633,"This single-vineyard Malbec blend from vineyards that sit at 6,500 feet smells dark, grilled and rubbery, but also meaty and full of fruit. A full, lush palate avoids fierceness and lays on the richness. Toasty, lightly herbal berry and plum flavors are highly appealing.

4634,"This is from a tremendous vineyard site near the top of the appellation, situated from 1,250 to 1,800 feet.

4642,"Portugal's native Touriga Nacional originally comes from the Dão and this wine shows it in its glory. Planted around an ornate 16th-century palace, the vines have produced a richly structured wine, still showing some signs of wood aging.

4643,"This is a mature, single-vineyard wine. Beautifully perfumed, it includes, unusually, a small percentage of white grapes (historically a field blend) that soften the tannins of the 90% Baga. The wine is spicy, concentrated, dense with black fruits and tannins. It is ready to drink.",Casca Wines 2012 Monte Cascas Vinha das Cardosas Red (Bairrada)
4644,"This is a limited production wine from small parcels of limestone soil. Aged in acacia barrels, it has subtle spice and toast flavors.

4652,"88-90 Barrel sample. A dark hued wine, with its tense tannins giving a strong backbone to the dry, firm structure. The fruit hardly shows through all this dry, extracted character.",Château Latour-Martillac 2008 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan)

This wine boasts solid structure and power.",Vietti 2003 Tre Vigne  (Barbera d'Asti)
4654,"88—90 Barrel sample. A wine with a high wood content, maybe too much – the question is over the fruit's ability to stand up to the blast of wood. The result is a wine that is super-spicy.",Château Bourgneuf-Vayron 2006 Barrel sample  (Pomerol)

4669,"Delicate and light-bodied with plenty to love in the nose, including irresistible notes of bread dough, strawberry and lemon which turn to fresh cherries in the mouth.

The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",Pine & Brown 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
4671,"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience.",Point & Line 2014 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)

4674,"Different and intriguing, this tightly wound wine has white pepper aromas, tart cherry and raspberry flavors and an engaging, astringent mouthfeel.

4675,"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit.

4676,"Farmed by the vineyard manager who owns Small Vines, another small Pinot Noir producer, this is a complex, well-crafted wine, high in acidity and high-toned red fruit, like cranberry, pomegranate and cherry, with a wisp of orange peel on their heels.

4678,"While subdued and closed off at initial tasting, time and aeration seem to bring out this wine's vibrant tangerine and apricot perfume.

4681,"Pretty in jasmine, lemon and orange, this is a crisp, dry and lovely wine, integrated with just enough heft on the body and a surprisingly deft length on the finish. Stock up for gatherings.",Kokomo 2015 Grenache Rosé (North Coast)
4682,"Closed and in need of air at first, this takes on a ripe, medicinal, almost candied red-fruit nose. Next up is a full, wide-bodied palate with chunky plum and raspberry flavors.

A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness.",MacPhail 2013 The Flyer Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
4686,"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture. It needs full-flavored, rich food to accompany it, and will deliver a lot of pleasure under those circumstances. Best to drink now through 2020.",Michael David 2013 Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
4687,"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.",Navarro 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
4688,"This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020.",Occasio 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
4689,"Another stunning deal on this annual bottling, this wine is jammy and fruity on the nose with buttered cherries and berry jam, yet layered with baking spice and wet clay minerality. Dried strawberries, black cherries and plums show on the palate, enhanced by a toasted clove, graphite, juniper and forest floor mintiness.",Pali 2014 Huntington Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
4690,"The signature bottling from this winery, this very dark blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petit Verdot, 13% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers deep black plum and black currant as well as cigar box, smoked beef and caramel on the nose. A blackberry-purée flavor leads the very fruit-driven palate, which is bolstered by black pepper, violet, shaved dark chocolate and espresso bean.",Pear Valley 2013 Distraction Red (Paso Robles)

4695,"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé.

The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.",Stephen Ross 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)

4699,"This Crianza is strapping on the nose, with fairly big but not overdone black-fruit aromas. A ripe, chewy palate with moderate tannins holds peppery wild berry flavors that settle on plum. A dark, toasty, peppery finish is mild and smooth. Overall, this offers a lot to like.",Bodegas Palacio 2012 Cosme Palacio Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja)
4700,"Dominated by Pinot Noir, this is a tight and stalky wine. It is almost too light, with its acidity and tight tannins to the front. Probably as it softens it will round out, so wait until late 2016 to drink.",Benoît Daridan 2014 Pinot Noir-Gamay (Cheverny)

4712,"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors. Big tannins need time in the glass to mellow.",Mount Veeder 2012 Reserve Red (Mount Veeder)

The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.",Podere Ruggeri Corsini 2012 Armujan  (Barbera d'Alba)
4717,This is a solid mineral and tannin dominated wine. It has black currant fruits which are still buried by the tense tannins and stalky texture. It therefore needs some time to develop and broaden out. Drink from 2018.,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2011 Pomares Red (Douro)

4727,"This estate-grown effort is almost jet black, and scented with tar, smoke and black fruits. It's dense beyond dense, and completely shut down.

Brief hints of tobacco and earth, cassis and coffee suggest that with more bottle age, this one could really blossom.",Ledger David 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley)

4732,"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes.

4741,"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.",Mirassou 1997 Harvest Reserve Merlot (California)
4742,"The big, powerful nose showcases blackberry, plum and brambly components. This tight, tannic, nicely constructed, ageworthy Cabernet features dark licorice streaks running through the long finish.",Seven Hills 1997 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
4743,"Lovely, fruity wine, with ripe apples and peaches dominating. But there's also plenty of toasty new oak and roasted hazelnuts. Soft and approachable, with a bright, hot finish.",Woodward Canyon 1999 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
4744,"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish. Good acid balance. It's still very young, but immediately delicious.",Kiona 1999 Ice Wine Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley)
4745,"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.",Bridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast)
4746,"An exceptional wine from this historic producer. Very aromatic, with generous blueberry, chocolate, mint, mushroom, and sweet charred oak. Rich and full-bodied. The fruity ripeness is delicious and sweet. The mouthfeel is luscious and creamy, and it finishes with a slight tannic bite. Probably at its youthful best now.",Louis M. Martini 1997 Merlot (Chiles Valley)
4747,"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",Robert Mondavi 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District)
4748,"They took only the best fruit they could find for this expensive wine, and made only 1,280 cases of it. Using every Burgundian trick in the book, winemaker Steve Test has created a rich, creamy wine, long on smoky oak and yeasty lees, with impressive spice and fruit that veers toward peaches and more tropical notes.",Merryvale 1998 Silhouette Chardonnay (California)
4749,"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Beckstoffer Ranch Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
4750,"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities. It drinks quite a bit softer, though, with lower acidity, which makes it seem richer, fatter, and more user friendly. You can taste the pretty fruit on the finish.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
4751,"The lovely, lushly fruity nose features plenty of buttery, roasted walnut scents from new oak fermentation. Despite the oak, it retains its freshness and acid balance, keeping it lively through a long, toasty finish.",Columbia Winery 1998 Otis Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
4752,"On one level this is a straightforward wine, varietally correct with lemony flavors. It's very dry and tart, with some nutty, oily nuances from 12% Sémillon. However, it has that undefinable something that makes it elegant and interesting. You find yourself reaching for it when richer, oakier, lusher wines pall.",Merryvale 1999 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California)
4753,"Blended with a small amount of Merlot (10%), this wine sends up a classic bouquet of cassis and berry, with a nice hint of mint. It’s well crafted, but tight and a little hard yet, especially in the finish. Built for aging.",Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
4754,"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish.",Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
4755,"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced.",Schug 1997 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros)
4756,"Dark, rich, and ultraripe yet balanced, this wine has plenty of charm. You can taste the warm California sunshine in each ripe sip. All kinds of wild berry and dark stone-fruit flavors mingle with spices and herbs, with a smoky, oaky overlay. Not great wine, but completely satisfying, and one that most will find lip-smackingly delicious.",Bridlewood 1998 Syrah (Paso Robles)
4757,"A new wine from a new winery. It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes. The wine, which is very dry, has been given the royal treatment, with barrel fermentation and extended lees aging, so there's that lovely creamy mouthfeel; malolactic fermentation softens it even more. Pretty lush stuff from a winery to watch.",Eagle & Rose Estate 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
4758,"Smells oakier and fruitier than the regular bottling, with pretty peach and green-apple notes. There's a fair amount of richness on the palate. The fruit is spicy and ripe, and the oak adds spice and a sappy sweetness. Very balanced and likable, and certainly a nice food wine.",Hoodsport 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
4759,"Columbia's second-tier Syrah uses Red Willow fruit from young plantings. The wine has a lovely black-plum color, and it's softly scented with chocolate, pepper and berries. Youthful, vibrant and sharp-toned, with the tart fruit cloaked in smooth, chocolaty tannins.",Columbia Winery 1998 Syrah (Yakima Valley)
4760,"This is a textbook traditional Rioja, with dry spice, earth, light herbal notes and leather on the nose alongside cherry and plum scents. The palate is crisp, elegant and pure, with raspberry, vanilla, plum and leathery flavors. Modest complexity and elegance rise up on the finish. Drink through 2018.",Bodegas Valdemar 2007 Conde de Valdemar Reserva  (Rioja)
4761,"Blackberry, black currant, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors mark this dry, tannic Cabernet. It shows real Oakville character, at a good price. Gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2015.",Cameron Hughes 2011 Lot 418 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
4762,"This forward Brunello opens with a fruit and spice fragrance of ripe black berries, cinnamon and hot red pepper. The dense palate delivers fleshy black cherry, ripe black raspberry, black pepper and cake spices alongside dusty tannins.",Il Poggione 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
4763,"Inky, floral depth with the spice of French oak leads to a fullish but toned body full of dark elderberry and plum fruits. There's a dark, brooding subtext despite the obviously mellowing oak flavors and a core of spice that will fulfil its promise with some further time in bottle. The concentrated power here comes from partially dried grapes. The tannins are pliable and supple. Enjoy as of 2016.",Juris 2011 Tricata Red (Weinland Österreich)
4764,"Voluptuous and savory, this Syrah is blended with 10% Viognier and the aromatics benefit as a result, a minerally mix of floral raspberry and vanilla. Earthy and leathery on the palate, it shows a taste of baked plum on the finish, as well as tobacco, a nice balance between Syrah's darker and brighter sides.",Kale 2009 Alder Springs Vineyard Spirit Rock Syrah (Mendocino County)
4765,"Freshly cut green pears and crunchy, ripe apples have immediate appeal. This fruity freshness continues on the sleek and super-clean palate, which leads to a refreshing, long finish.",Zull 2012 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich)
4766,"From an eight-acre vineyard, this is produced by the same team as Château Paloumey. Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017.",Château La Garricq 2011  Moulis-en-Médoc
4767,"This is a delightfully perfumed wine, the second wine of Château L'Evangile. Smooth with ripe Merlot flavors, it's full and dense, conveying the sense that it will mature quickly. Drink from 2016.",Château l'Évangile 2011 Blason de l'Evangile  (Pomerol)
4768,"A firm, dense wine, it currently shows plenty of dry tannins along with potentially ripe fruits. Already showing balance, it is developing into a complex, rich wine that will be full of black fruits and smoother tannins. Drink from 2017.",Château Saint-Estèphe 2011  Saint-Estèphe
4769,"Generous, sweetly perfumed aromas of melon and lemon oil lead into a wine with precision and penetration. Spicy, candied ginger complements the citrus and tropical fruit, and barrel fermentation gives it a gently buttery mouthfeel.",Coeur d'Alene 2012 Viognier (Washington)
4770,"This wine shows real depth, beginning with earthy aromas of underbrush, ripe berried fruit, blue flower and smidge of leather. The palate offers a core of black cherry accented with notes of baking spices and a hint of truffle alongside a solid tannic backbone and nervous acidity that restrains the berry richness. Drink 2016–2024.",Conti Costanti 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
4771,"This earthy Brunello leads with aromas of underbrush, mushroom, bay leaf, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. The palate offers juicy black cherry and ripe raspberry punctuated with cinnamon-spice, vanilla, mocha and licorice alongside smoothed but fleeting tannins. It's nicely crafted and boasts decent freshness for the vintage.",Corte dei Venti 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
4772,"Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes go into this soft, plush, totally drinkable Chardonnay. Pretty fruit flavors of banana, apple and pear mingle seamlessly, and the wine has both balance and texture to spare. Drink it now for its poise and freshness.",DaMa 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
4773,"Chunky, slightly rubbery aromas revolve around black fruits and oak. This is a dense, thick wine with blackberry, plum, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dark and weighty in this meaty Malbec.",DiamAndes 2011 de Uco Malbec (Uco Valley)
4774,"Aromas of dried cheese, iodine and candied fruits settle with airing. In the mouth, this is firm and tannic, with savory, oaky flavors of hickory, blackened toast and roasted berry fruits. On the finish, there's both weight and elegance. Best from 2015 through 2020.",Emilio Moro 2010  Ribera del Duero
4775,"This delivers a classic Sangiovese nose of wild cherry, leather, violet, iris, flint and spice. The dense palate reveals fleshy black cherry uplifted by menthol, eucalyptus, black pepper and sage. It's still young but should develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink 2016–2023.",Fattoria dei Barbi 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
4776,"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.",Finca Lalande 2012 Made with organically grown grapes Malbec (Tupungato)
4777,"Subdued aromas of pear peel give way to fleshy pear fruit framed with grapefruit acidity. Harmonious and reined-in, the wine combines elegance with fruity concentration.",Fritsch 2012 Mordthal Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland)
4778,"Chardonnays from Mount Veeder are rare, but the mountain can be a good home for that variety. Godspeed's 2012 is dry, brisk in acidity and enormously rich in tropical fruit, pear and apricot fruit flavors, enhanced with oak. Drink this Chard now with fancy fare, such as wild mushroom risotto, ahi tuna tartare and chicken lasagna.",Godspeed 2012 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Mount Veeder)
4779,"Lovely restraint and a soft, pliable creamy core on this concentrated wine that boasts buffered acidity as clear and pretty as a bell.",Gross 2012 Sulz Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark)
4780,"This food-friendly Pinot Noir has a light body, dryness and crisp acidity that make it easy to pair with steaks, chops, salmon, mushroom risotto and similar fare. There's nothing shy, however, about the flavors, which brim with ripe raspberries, cherries and pomegranates, accented with toasty, spicy oak. Drink now–2017.",Rodney Strong 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
4781,"Dark berry and baking spice aromas emerge from the glass and carry over to the juicy palate together with fleshy wild cherry, plum, black pepper, cinnamon and vanilla alongside big round tannins. Well balanced with great length, this poised wine already is accessible, so drink 2015–2019.",San Lorenzo 2009 Bramante  (Brunello di Montalcino)
4782,"Yeasty aromas give way to a ripe, plump palate. Varietally typical phenolic richness is kept in check by acidity.",Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)

4784,"Licorice, cardamom, blueberry and cassis aromas are subtle but complementary. A firm, healthy feel isn't particularly hard or tannic, while candied berry and sweet oak flavors lead to a long, smooth finish. This blend of 67% Malbec and 33% Cab Sauvignon is ripe, ready and exemplifies Mendoza's penchant for big wines with balance. Only 150 cases made.",TeHo 2011 Red Blend Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
4785,"Although the color is an evolved garnet with brick edges, this wine offers a fresh nose of blue flower, gingerbread and ripe cherry with hints of toast and clove. The palate is evolved but still delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla and espresso along with smoothed tannins and soft acidity. Not much complexity and even though it's forward, it's also balanced. Drink through 2019.",Tenuta di Sesta 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
4786,"Brawny and forward, it leads with alluring fragrances of blue flower, underbrush, forest berries, balsamic herbs and leather. The juicy palate delivers mature wild cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, thyme and mint. While already deliciously accessible, it should develop some complexity in the next few years but don't hold too long. Drink through 2019.",Terre Nere 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
4787,"Vintner Adriano Gigante delivers a thick, resiny Ribolla Gialla with aromas of candied fruit, caramel and apricot. Try this pretty wine with ravioli stuffed with yellow squash.",Gigante 2010 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
4788,"White flowers and peach start this slightly simple but good white from Greece. On the palate, lemon and orange flavors join with a honeyed spice. The overall character is balanced and friendly.",Greek Wine Cellars 2010 Moscofilero Moschofilero (Mantinia)
4789,"On the sugary side, with sweetened pineapple, green apple and peach flavors that are brightened with crisp acidity. If you like your white wines on the sweet side, this is a good price.",Bella Ragazza 2010 Pinot Grigio (California)
4790,"Shows plenty of oak influence, wrapping around tropical fruit notes. It's richly textured if somewhat low in acid, giving it a weighty feel on the palate. Drink now.",Vinum 2010 White Elephant White (California)
4791,"There's a chalky, almost sweet element to the mouthfeel that recalls Pez candy or lemon soda. The fruit aromas are bright, intense and make up for the streamlined mouthfeel.",Castelfeder 2010 15er Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
4792,"Lunaria is a very interesting wine that represents one of the only attempts at making Sauvignon Blanc in the Forlì area of central Italy. Great for appetizers or easy vegetarian pasta dishes, it offers citrus, passion fruit and chopped sage aromas.",Castelluccio 2009 Lunaria Sauvignon Blanc (Forlì)
4793,This crisp Vermentino would make a great companion to smoked salmon or swordfish carpaccio. The wine is bright and zesty with simple citrus and spice on the close.,Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini 2009 Massi di Mandorlaia Vermentino (Maremma)
4794,"This wine has the plucky character typical of Greece, but with a polished spin. The nose is allspice, cherry and cocoa, and on the palate, dried fruits, coffee, mesquite smoke and chocolate. The wine finishes spicy and clean. Good, if not a bit aggressive. Pair with meat or hearty fare.",Estate Constantin Gofas 2008 Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
4795,"Here's an easy Grechetto from central Italy that offers sun-denched aromas of apricot, honeysuckle, white mineral and a touch of tangy, sweet spice. This native Italian grape pairs beautifully with white meat, fish or salad.",Fongoli 2009 Grechetto (Colli Martani)
4796,"Generic on the nose, with undistinguished aromas of red fruits and candy. Feels plump and tastes a bit stalky, with generic red cherry, plum skin and candied flavors. Harmless and a touch sweet; drink well chilled.",Kaiken 2010 Rosé of Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
4797,"This Moschofilero starts with honeyed peach, spice and lemon aromas, followed by a light touch of peach and minerals on the palate. Easy drinking and linear, this wine will pair well with cheese and light fare.",Lafazanis 2010 Electus Moschofilero (Mantinia)
4798,"Made with organically farmed fruit, this bright blend of Grechetto (80%) and Malvasia offers easy aromas of citrus, grapefruit and a touch of mature pineapple. The wine is fresh, lean and compact.",Moretti Omero 2009 Nessuno White (Umbria)
4799,"Shows the weakness of certain Napa Valley Chardonnays, with a dry herbaceous taste that accentuates the acidity and even the tannins. Although there are pineapple and oak flavors, the wine lacks interest.",Peter Franus 2010 Chardonnay (Carneros)
4800,"Fresh, informal and fun (in a screwcap bottle), this organically farmed Pinot Grigio delivers bright aromas of cut grass, exotic fruit and citrus. It's an easy wine with a carefree attitude.",TerrAmore 2010 Pinot Grigio (Veneto)
4801,"You almost have to classify this Riesling as a dessert wine, because it crosses the line from off-dry into frankly sweet. It's an easy sipper, with honeyed tangerine and pear flavors. Could be a little brighter in acidity, though.",Bogle 2010 Riesling (California)
4802,"Luscious aromas of ripe peach and citrus are followed by balanced waves of peach, lemon curd and melon on the palate. Soft in style and approachable, this is a good everyday white that drinks very well on its own or paired with poultry, salads.",Boutari 2010 Moschofilero (Mantinia)
4803,"Shows ripe, grapey raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with a bite of citrusy acidity. A good Pinot Noir for drinking with roast salmon or a juicy hamburger.",Carmel Road 2010 Pinot Noir (Monterey)
4804,"Carpineto consistently delivers clean, territory-driven wines at competitive prices. This lively Vernaccia opens with green apple, cut grass and dried sage aromas. It would pair nicely with a heaping plate of fried calamari rings.",Carpineto 2010  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
4805,"A value-driven Cabernet to be sure and one, under the Conservancy mantra, that serves to raise funds to protect vineyard land from urban development. This vintage is full, with baked plum and earthy flavors, even-handed overall, with a hint of green bean on the finish.",Concannon 2009 Conservancy Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
4806,"A heavy, dark and loud Malbec with bullish floral and black fruit aromas. Offers vise-grip tannins and borderline-overpowering blackberry flavors. Darkens on the finish, leaving espresso bitterness and chocolaty spice.",DiamAndes 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley)
4807,"It's a proper Pinot Noir in the silky texture and cherry and cola flavors, which finish smooth and dry. Other than that, it's rustic and heavy.",J. Lohr 2010 Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
4808,"Rounded, ripe, this Grüner is finely balanced, with apple flavors and a citric edge. It has intense acidity with a creamy character, and is ready to drink now. Screwcap.",Laurenz V. 2010 Laurenz and Sophie Singing Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
4809,This quickly veers from being delicately light into simply sour and grassy. Cucumber- and tart melon-flavored fruit fades into a short finish.,LaVelle 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
4810,"The vineyard is a great one, but this Chardonnay tastes way too oaky. It's swamped by buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch flavors that barely give the underlying pineapple and lemon fruits a chance to express themselves.",Merryvale 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
4811,"Simple, clean and fresh, this no-fuss Pinot Grigio would pair nicely against Chinese take-out or an outdoor salad lunch. It shows clean aromas of citrus and white peach.",Montresor 2010 Pinot Grigio (Valdadige)
4812,"There's a toasty streak that adds depth to the apple and melon fruit core of this wine. Soft tropical fruit accents appear in the mouth, with a brioche-flavored finish sealing the deal.",Mullineux 2011 Kloof Street Chenin Blanc (Swartland)
4813,This expression of Müller-Thurgau is thin and crisp in the mouth with lemon and candied fruit aromas on the nose. The aromas are flatter and less floral than you might expect from this fragrant grape variety.,Nals Margreid 2009 Müller-Thurgau (Alto Adige)
4814,"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.",Chaltén 2007 Reserva Pinot Noir (Neuquén)
4815,"The main nonvintage Champagne from Drappier is open, fresh and very easy. The fruit shows pears and apricots, tightened up by some green apple skins. The general feel is softness. An enjoyable apéritif Champagne.",Drappier NV Carte d'Or Brut  (Champagne)
4816,"This is a drily astringent Zinfandel with bracing acidity, and it's a little tough right now. But it has enough briary mountain berry fruit, clove and savory pepper flavors to work against barbecued meats and poultry.",Fernwood 2005 Estate Zinfandel (Santa Cruz Mountains)
4817,"Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay. It has pleasant pineapple, peach and lemon flavors and crisp acidity, and while it's not especially complex, it's a nice Chard for drinking now.",Hendry 2005 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
4818,"A little sweet and jammy, this Grenache has pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with brown sugar, cinnamon, anise and cocoa. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity, but the wine is fundamentally simple and charming.",Vino Sapien 2006 Thompson Vineyard Granddaddy Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
4819,"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges.",La Fenêtre 2006 Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County)
4820,"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",Mercer 2007 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
4821,"This is a good, every day effort, much like the baseline Ste. Michelle Sauvignon Blancs. Lightly grassy, lemony and tart, it is an all-purpose quaffer.",Mercer 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
4822,"A beat or two off the pace of previous vintages, the '04 is a little soft and one-dimensional. Tastes like it was baked by the heat, with jammy white and yellow fruit flavors that have a trace of bitterness.",Merryvale 2004 Silhouette Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
4823,"A fine unoaked Pinot Grigio that shows the crispness, delicate body and richness you want in this variety. The citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors could be drier, but lots of people will enjoy that edge of sugar.",Pietra Santa 2007 Amore Pinot Grigio (Cienega Valley)
4824,"Has Petite Sirah's inky black color and strong, thick tannins, and is very dry, with blackberry flavors that could be a little more intense. Unless you like your red wines right out of the cradle, this one really needs cellaring through at least 2010.",Prospero 2006 Petite Sirah (Sonoma County)
4825,"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average.",Robert Mondavi 2006 To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Oakville)
4826,"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now.",Ortman Family 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles)
4827,"Soft, light, frothy apéritif style, pleasantly balanced with pear flavors. The aftertaste is soft, but the balance remains. Attractive, uncomplicated.",Mansard NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
4828,"Dry and delicately structured, this is a high-acid, fairly austere wine. The flavors of tobacco, tart cherry skins and pepper will seem insufficient to fans of fruit-driven wines, but give this Dolcetto the right Italian-inspired fare, and it will shine.",Mosby 2006 Dolcetto (Santa Barbara County)
4829,"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.",Covey Run 2006 Quail Series Fumé Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
4830,"A little tough and gritty, but with rich, forward flavors of berry and cherry jam, cocoa, clove and anise flavors. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.",Foxen 2005 Range 30 West Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
4831,"Very soft, with low acidity and a texture as creamy as pudding, this Petite Sirah is made for early drinking. It's frankly delicious, with blackberry, currant, cherry, raspberry, chocolate and pepper-spice flavors that flood the mouth with opulence.",Ursa 2005 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills)
4832,"Edna Valley is a pretty chilly growing area, and you can taste the climate in the thick tannins and zingy acids that mark this Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's classic flavors of blackberries and currants, with notes of dried leather, tobacco, beefsteak and pepper.",Wolff 2006 Petite Sirah (Edna Valley)
4833,"A bit too brittle and tart to earn a higher score. Could be bottle shock, but it's hard to tell. Tasted in May, the wine showed mint-infused cherry flavors and turned sharp on the finish. Made from 100% Grenache.",Zaca Mesa 2006 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley)
4834,"My bottle was sulfury on opening, but it blew off quickly. Then the wine revealed itself as very soft and somewhat simple, although dry. It shows modest flavors of ripe crushed summer blackberries and pepper.",Handley 2005 Handley Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
4835,"A little green and minty, with sweet cherry, vanilla cream and smoke flavors brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",Brander 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
4836,"This is a sweet, soft Port, with plenty of fruit. Sultana and orange jelly flavors are cut with some spirit. The wine leans much more towards fruit than wood, unusual for a 20-year old. The wine, like all aged tawnies, is ready to drink.",Messias NV 20 Anos Tawny  (Port)
4837,"Orange, nectarine, canned pear and honeysuckle show on the nose of this quaffable bottling. The palate is nicely creamy but not overly thick, with banana cream and pear-mousse flavors that grow increasingly tropical as the sip lingers.",Pear Valley 2014 Pear Valley Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles)
4838,"Subdued aromas of blackberry, grilled herb and a hint of menthol lead the way. The straightforward, easy-drinking palate offers mature black cherry, coffee and a hint of brown spice alongside soft, round tannins. Enjoy through 2017.",Piccini 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
4839,"This is fresh, fruity and with an attractive creamy texture. The crisp apple comes from the high-acid Rabigato grape that's softened by Viosinho and Gouveio. That makes for a balanced, light wine that is ready to drink.",Quinta do Crasto 2014 Crasto White (Douro)
4840,"Towards the western end of the Douro vineyards, Avidagos is a fine place for table wines. This young, ripe and rounded wine is made to be drunk young. It has great black fruits and acidity that are linked by the firm tannin background. The wine will be ready from the end of 2016.",Quinta dos Avidagos 2014 Avidagos Red (Douro)
4841,"Pungent aromas of wet stones, citrus fruits, grass and bell pepper are lively and intense. This has a crisp, clean palate and pyrazine-based flavors of nettle, bell pepper and lime. On the finish, it remains racy until the end.",Quintay 2015 Q Grand Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
4842,"A smooth texture and ripe, inviting black cherry flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to drink and enjoy. Light spicy accents give it extra interest and moderate tannins help build the suave mouthfeel.",Rickshaw 2014 Pinot Noir (California)
4843,"This is a serviceable, soft and widely distributed wine, yeasty with aromas of baked bread circling concentrated red fruit and black tea. Light bodied and youthful, it holds on to oak and tannin on the finish.",Robert Mondavi 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
4844,"Some may find this coastal SB to be too green and vegetal, but that's cool-climate Leyda in a nutshell.

4945,"A cooler vintage in the Columbia Valley, which perhaps contributes to a wine that seems rather hard and thin. Though the alcohol is listed at 14.2%, the fruit is tight and one dimensional, with dominant acidity. The wine is sound and balanced, but not showing its best at the moment.",Trust 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
4946,"This easy Poggio Stella Merlot is redolent of black cherry, mature raspberry and currants. It's aged in oak casks for six months to add a playful touch of spice and toast. Pair this well-priced Italian wine with grilled sausage or meatloaf.",Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano 2008 Poggio Stella Merlot (Cortona)
4947,"Rich and ripe, with soft tannins and black plum flavors. It is round, while still having a core of attractive tannins. The fruit dominates, giving a friendly, accessible wine.",Alente 2007 Premium Red (Alentejo)
4948,"Fresh, juicy wine, with soft tannins and taut red cherry fruit. The tannins provide a discreet backbone. Age for 2–3 years.",Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2010 JP Azeitão Tinto Red (Setubal)
4949,"A sweet style of sparkling wine, with brisk acidity framing orange, lime, vanilla and honey flavors. Nice with wedding cake, at a good price.",Barefoot Bubbly NV Moscato Spumante Champagne Sparkling (California)
4950,"With a few years in bottle, this is maturing well. It has ripeness, the tannins beginning to soften into rich spice and damson jelly flavors. The acidity is still very present as is the dry core.",Chateau de Launay 2005 Les Vignes de Julia  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
4951,"This soft, sweet, oaky Cabernet will appeal to those who like the New World style. It's as puffy as a dessert concoction, with cherry, chocolate, nougat and cinnamon spice flavors, and is ready to drink now.",Cobblestone 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
4952,"A good, off-dry useful wine for drinking across the board with a wide variety of fare, or by itself as a cocktail. It's brisk and clean, with pleasant citrus, apricot, spice and vanilla flavors.",Dancing Derby 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
4953,"A solid Zin for everyday drinking. A little rough and thin, but dry and spicy, with berry, currant and teriaki flavors.",De Loach 2009 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
4954,"Melon and almond skin aromas lead to pithy citrus on what amounts to a pretty good bouquet. Round, citrusy and fresh in the mouth, with orange, passion fruit and tropical leanings. Solid and well shaped for a $7 quaffer. 70% Airen and 30% Macabeo.",Dominio de Eguren 2010 Protocolo Blanco White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
4955,"Mint and milk chocolate are the lead aromas, followed by cherry and herbal notes. The wine is basic, fresh and fruity, with choppy tannins, heat and lively red berry flavors with citrus undertones. Runs a bit rough and heady.",El Escocés Volante 2009 La Multa Old Vine Garnacha (Calatayud)
4956,"With three years' aging, this has developed into an almond- and toast-flavored wine that has softened and rounded the fruit. It has turned into a serious wine, its rich structure allied to the acidity. Ready to drink.",Domaine Roblin 2010 Ammonites  (Sancerre)
4957,"This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.",Écluse 2010 Ensemble Lock Vineyard Red (Paso Robles)
4958,"Right away you know this Syrah-Petit Verdot is a powerful wine. The bouquet is pointed and blasts away with cherry, berry, spice and oak aromas. It's thick, pushy and full-bodied, with minty, toasty oak flavors running side by side with blackberry. On the finish, it's more charred and toasty, with peppery spice and some heat. Drink now–2015.",Finca Constancia 2010 Syrah-Petit Verdot (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
4959,"Sommeliers will appreciate this Chardonnay for its dryness and elegance, not to mention the price. It favors restraint over flamboyance, yet offers plenty of rich tropical and citrus fruits, with hints of honey and minerals. The alcohol is refreshingly balanced.",Bump 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
4960,"Here's a gorgeous wine to pair with foie gras or pâté. A Riserva expression of Gewürztraminer, it opens with a bright golden color and segues to intense aromas of honey, candied peach, yellow rose, lemon curd and natural rubber. In the mouth, the wine is rich, opulent and long-lasting.",Cantina Cortaccia 2009 Brenntal Riserva Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
4961,Here is a beautiful Pinot Bianco with aromas of melon and stone fruit that pop right out of the glass. This white variety is generally known for the richness of its mouthfeel more than its bouquet. But this expression excels on both the nose and in the mouth thanks to its intensity and purity.,Cantina Produttori Bolzano S. Maddalena/Gries 2011 Dellago Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
4962,"Powerful and rich, this is a concentrated, wood-aged wine. It has toasted almonds as well as ripe pear and green-plum fruit. With a fine tension under the fruitiness, it will age over several years.",Château de la Roulerie 2011 Les Terrasses Chenin Blanc (Anjou)
4963,"Full-bodied, fruity wine that has wood aging flavors along with red plum and strawberry fruits. Smoky, perfumed, this is a wine that shows fresh fruit with a good depth of flavor. Age for 2–3 years.",Château la Varière 2010 Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac)
4964,"A finely crafted, complex Cabernet that shows classic Napa construction. The tannins are very fine and the acidity balancing, while the flavors are rich in black currants, minerals and cedar. Drink now–2017.",ZD 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
4965,"This wine shows the glamour you expect from a Phelps Cabernet. It's softly tannic and rich in blackberries, currants, licorice and cedar, with a lovely structure. Nice to drink now, right out of the bottle. Easy to find, with 17,300 cases produced.",Joseph Phelps 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
4966,"This is a really good showing for the Garnacha Blanca grape. The bouquet is fresh and not the least bit blowsy, with an emphasis on apple and pear aromas. The wine is plump, fruity and showing modest acidity, while flavors of apple and baking spices precede a finish that's easygoing. Drink now.",Lafou 2011 Els Ameliers Garnacha Blanca (Terra Alta)
4967,"As a whole, this is top-shelf Malbec with weight, character and complexities. It's also a touch gamy on the nose, with a no-miss blast of compost. Beyond that, the palate shows lemony oak and tight tannins on top of oaky, leathery flavors of robust berry and baked plum. Drink this rock-solid specimen now through 2016.",Monteviejo 2008 Lindaflor Malbec (Mendoza)
4968,"Ripe black currant aromas set this wine on its full, warm path. It is intensely fruity with a rounded feel to it. The acidity cuts through the ripe character, giving tension and a piercing crisp aftertaste.",Patient Cottat 2010 Anciennes Vignes  (Sancerre)
4969,"Pécharmant produces some of the most dense reds of Bergerac, and this wine from Ancienne Cure shows some of the same character in a more fruity version. Black fruits and firm tannins are layered with forward acidity to give a wine that will be approachable this year.",Domaine l'Ancienne Cure 2011 Sélection Jour de Fruit  (Pécharmant)
4970,"Initially youthfully crisp and herbaceous, the wine then broadens into riper more yellow-fruit flavors. That gives it richness and weight that balance with the grapefruit and lemon-juice freshness. Give this fine wine a year to meld together",Domaine Seguin 2011  Pouilly-Fumé
4971,"You don't see much Syrah from the Veneto in northeast Italy, but Cicogna shows that the variety does have a future here. This expression is soft and plump with ripe fruit, blackberry, leather and tobacco. There's a point of bright freshness on the long finish.",Domenico Cavazza 2009 Cicogna Syrah (Veneto)
4972,"Over the past few years, San Pedro has consistently put out excellent SBs under its 1865 label. This sings of coastal Chilean Sauvignon via mineral, passion fruit and grapefruit aromas. In the mouth, it's chiseled like a statue, with a mix of citrus and green flavors. Expect a cutting, crisp, zesty finish.",San Pedro 2012 1865 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
4973,"With a depth of ripe cherry flavor, Sean Thackrey's Wentzel Clone 777, shows concentration and weight, with a riper, fleshier and bolder character than its clonal companions grown in the same vineyard block.",Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
4974,"Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better. With keen acidity and a brisk minerality, it shows complex flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits, and hints of riper, richer tropical fruits.",Tolosa 2011 Pure Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
4975,"A fancy Syrah, dry, complex and interesting to drink. It packs in a lot of blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, accented with a sweet jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is a bit high, resulting in some heat. Drink soon.",Transcendence 2010 La Paloma Larner Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
4976,"Ripe, forward flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola mark this Pinot Noir. It's gentle in the mouth and nice and low in alcohol. Seems too soft for aging, so drink over the next 2–3 years with a great steak.",Alysian 2010 Floodgate Vineyard Rock Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
4977,"Shows good varietal character in a somewhat sweet format. It starts off slightly musky and gingery on the nose, then adds lychee fruit flavors. For its sweetness, it's not particularly richly textured or weighty, making it a possibility as an apéritif.",Grafen Neipperg 2006 Neipperger Schlossberg Auslese Traminer (Württemberg)
4978,"This unusual dry Gewürztraminer puts the flavor focus squarely on grapefruit and pineapple, with a bone-dry acid underpinning. It has moderate concentration and length, with alcohol rated at just 12.5%.",Bonair 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley)
4979,"Thick and brawny, this Sicilian Shiraz boasts a deep purple hue and presents in-your-face aromas of prune, cedar, blueberry and white peppercorn. The consistency is chunky and chewy, like play dough, but drying mineral tones help cap those jammy fruit flavors.",Calatrasi 2005 Accademia del Sole Shiraz (Sicilia)
4980,"Thick and luscious with deep oak tones and big cherry fruit flavors, this southern Italian red is a real fruit bomb with plush cherry intensity and ripe berry flavors. The strong sunshine has done its part to shape a thick, succulent red wine.",Cantele 2006 Amativo Red (Salento)
4981,"Fresh black currant fruit gives this wine all the vivacity of the 2006 vintage. It is a beautiful, elegantly crafted wine, as you would expect from the same team as Château Ausone, and it has a lovely lightness of touch, with its final note one of delicious juiciness.",Château de Fonbel 2006  Saint-Émilion
4982,"A wood-dominated wine that shows spice and high toast characters. It has probably seen too much wood in its aging, but there is fruit there, its black currant ripeness hiding in the background. Hopefully, the wood will soften and integrate.",Château Fonréaud 2006  Listrac-Médoc
4983,"A touch funky and green at first, that soon blows off to reveal a dark and wonderfully concentrated wine that shows some serious promise with age. Cassis, plum, black cherry, spice and tobacco fill the palate, with a long, smoky finish sealing the deal. Drink after 2010. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",Château Maris 2005 Old Vine Syrah (Minervois La Liviniere)
4984,"This is a very attractive wine with bursting cherry notes and vibrant layers of sweet spice and clove. You'll also get root beer, chopped herbs, tobacco and leather: the wine is thick and firm with oak-driven flavors.",Colli di Lapio 2005 Donna Chiara Campi Taurasini Aglianico (Irpinia)
4985,"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish.",Domaine Lignères 2003 La Baronne Red (Corbières)
4986,"Archetypal Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, featuring pungent, herbal aromas to go alongside bold passion fruit notes. It shows ample weight in the mouth, even a slightly oily texture and pronounced green flavors that persist a good long time. Probably best with fresh tomato or strongly herbal dishes.",Drylands 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
4987,"Pleasant and melony on the nose, without the sharp, piercing aromas that sometimes push Chilean SB over the edge. New from the north of Chile, Elki is medium-bodied and generous, but not too angular. It's a whole wine with common citrus flavors as opposed to something demanding and sharp.Drink right away.",Elki 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Elqui Valley)
4988,"Honey-sweet and direct, with citrus jam, apricot essence, crème brûlée and vanilla cream flavors. Fine with white cookies, lemon chiffon pie, pineapple sorbet.",Prager 2004 Madeline Riesling (Napa Valley)
4989,"Fresh, fruity and charming, this rosé offers full-bodied flavors of strawberry and spice that are balanced and complex. A step above the typical flirty rosé, the wine gives style and substance and will handle heartier dishes—think Moroccan tagine or grilled, spiced fish.",Rietvallei Estate Wine 2007 Juanita Rosé Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson)
4990,"This is a pleasantly intense wine with resiny aromas of tar, tobacco and smoked cedar wood. It has a dense, impenetrable personality and there are slightly bitter tannins on the close.",Salvatore Molettieri 2006 Cinque Querce Aglianico (Irpinia)
4991,"Torre Pieve is a thick and creamy Chardonnay that is half aged in oak and half in stainless steel. These two methods give the wine structure and softness, but they also allow for the wine's natural fragrances to stay intact.",Santa Maria 2004 Torre Pieve Chardonnay (Veneto)
4992,"Shaw and Smith's Sauvignon Blanc has become emblematic of the Adelaide Hills style, combining tropical fruit with a grassy streak, all framed by zippy citrus flavors. This would work equally as an apéritif or with various seafood dishes.",Shaw and Smith 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
4993,"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices. As good as it is, it lacks a refined elegance, and its hope lies in the cellar.",Talley 2006 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
4994,"Tedeschi's Ripasso offers unique aromas that recall forest berry, bramble, green spice and crushed bay leaf. It's a succulent and slightly sweet tasting wine with bursting fruit flavors and thick, chewy density.",Tedeschi 2005 Capitel San Rocco Red (Rosso del Veronese)
4995,"Sweaty and pungent, loaded with overtones of crushed tomato leaf, this is an assertively herbal wine that requires careful food pairing, or a healthy preference for that style. It's not terribly weighty, but shows nice leafy complexity and a hint of curranty fruit. Try it with mussels steamed with lots of fresh herbs.",Mud House 2007 Swan Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
4996,Here's a well-toasted red wine from Southern Italy that sees eight months of oak for added aromas of spice and tobacco. It has a sophisticated edge and loads of fresh fruit nuances at the core.,Fattoria Alois 2006 Cunto Pallagrello (Campania)
4997,"Candied fruit and caramel ride on the back of maple syrup, allspice and ground ginger. Marsala is for much more than cooking and you can try this wine with aged cheese or as an after-dinner drink.",Florio NV Fine Sweet  (Marsala)
4998,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is soft and ready to drink now. It's also very delicious, almost like a dessert pastry, with ultra-ripe black cherry, cassis, anise liqueur, melted milk chocolate and vanilla flavors that finish spicy-sweet.",Vice Versa 2005 Le Petit Vice Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Sonoma-Napa)
4999,"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness. There's bite and sass to this one, and the finish is quite long.",Viña Mar de Casablanca 2008 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
5000,"Slightly funky and leesy on the nose, with somewhat sweaty overtones to the citrus and apple aromas. But the flavors are pure, suggesting that the aromatics just need some time to come around—or a quick decanting. It's medium in body, with a crisp, tangy finish that artfully balances sweet and tart.",Willi Haag 2007 Brauneberger Juffer Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
5001,"Co-fermented with Viognier from the same vineyard, this is a lovely counterpoint to the big, bruising Barrister Bacchus Vineyard Syrah. Violets and chocolate dominate, with wild herb and cured meat flavors through the midpalate. Tannins are chewy and textured, with some stem and bark flavors.",Barrister 2006 Morrison Lane Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5002,"Minerally slate and sultry apricot and peach start this elegant white. A waxy palate and soft, feminine flavors of honeysuckle and flowers—as well as a burst of fruit—give the wine a rich but pretty character.",Brampton 2007 Viognier (Coastal Region)
5003,"Nicely styled, showing lots of licorice in the nose and in the flavors. Blackberry and plum, cedar and spice are gently introduced, and the balance of fruit, acid and tannin is taut and proportionate.",Cadaretta 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
5004,"Dry, lean and structured, here is a wine that initially seems to be missing its fruit. There are hints of black cherries and plum skins, but they are always going to be surrounded by a heavy tannic presence.",Château Cos Labory 2006  Saint-Estèphe
5005,"Ripe Merlot pushes through the tight tannins that are still evident in this wine. This dark, dry core dominates initially, and needs time to open up to show the vivid black currant flavors, touched with dried fruits and fresh finishing acidity.",Château Teyssier 2006  Saint-Émilion
5006,"Chatter Creek's value-priced Bordeaux blend is often his most appealing red wine upon release. This is scented with hard cherry candy, and the flavors follow right on course. It needs some breathing time to open out, and as it does, the finish lingers with pleasing streaks of coffee and toast.",Chatter Creek 2006 Blend 105 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
5007,"One of Spain's great full-force, modern-style wines, this excels despite the marginal 2008 vintage. It's open-knit and soft on the nose, with ladels of spice, graphite and black fruit aromas. It feels fresh, balanced and not overly tannic, with strapping blackberry, coffee, chocolate, spice and tobacco flavors all rolled into a fabulous whole. Licorice, espresso and amaro notes grace the padded finish. Drink now–2018.",Maurodos 2008 San Román  (Toro)
5008,"This is co-fermented Old Stones Vineyard and Cailloux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Syrah (40%), showing the funk of the terroir and less of the varietal character of the fruit. It's flavorful and textural, with earth, anise and smoke notes, plus a mineral-driven wet-stone base and exceptional length.",K Vintners 2009 The Creator Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5009,"A four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, this packs 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Refined and elegant, it is precisely structured, with a firm herbal attack and a perfect blend of berry and cassis flavors. It's dense, deep and compact, suggesting long aging ahead.",Pirouette 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
5010,"A wonderful 100% Cabernet, this is Prime's first wine to bear the new Coombsville appellation. It's smooth, elegant and complex, with layers of blackberry and crème de cassis. It's beautiful now and over the next eight years.",Prime 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
5011,"Truly stunning, the Lewis Estate Riesling from Dunham explodes with fragrant fruits—citrus, melon and tropical. A symphony of subtle accents, such as powdered sugar, candied citrus peel and breakfast tea, this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings.",Dunham 2010 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
5012,"This is made from fruit sourced from the oldest block of Syrah in Washington, which was planted in 1986. The nose expresses complex varietal character, with a mix of blue and purple berry, a dusting of earth and accents of cinnamon and incense. Subtle and expressive, this is the best vintage to date for the Patriarche.",Betz Family 2010 La Côte Patriarche Syrah (Yakima Valley)
5013,"One of the best Napa Cabernet Francs in memory, this shows lush, concentrated flavors of cherry pie, red currant, mocha, anise and smoky, spicy sandalwood that are wrapped into firm but exceptionally refined tannins. Drink now to experience the youthful beauty.",Constant 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
5014,"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul.",Signorello 2009 Padrone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5015,"A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5016,"This delicious 100% Cabernet is supple and generous. The tannins are gentle, the acidity soft yet supportive of the structure, and as for the flavors, they go beyond satisfaction into sheer delight. They include blackberry, cherry, blueberry, currant, mocha and red licorice, but the wine has an earthiness and minerality that give it true complexity. This is Stag's Leap's most accessible 2009 Cabernet, easily earning its high score for sheer delight. Drink now–2015.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 FAY Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5017,"This will be the last Ovide from En Cerise grapes. It's an explosion of cherry and milk chocolate flavors, remaining firm with expressive highlights of olive, earth and herb. It is two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah, a perfect melding of the two grapes. Arguably, one gets better aromatics than Charles Smith, and the wine flavors deliver on their initial promise.",K Vintners 2009 En Cerise Ovide Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5018,"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard, showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace. Given a full 24 hours of breathing time, it opens further into a dazzling, rich mix of cherry and cassis that's soaked in an herbal broth.",K Vintners 2009 The Beautiful Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5019,"Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, crème de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar. Try after 2018.",Lamborn Family Vineyards 2008 Vintage VI Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
5020,"Concentrated and wonderfully aromatic, this ages for 32 months in 75% new French oak, plus another 28 months in bottle prior to its release. Smooth as silk, it mixes berry, cherry and plum notes, with whiffs of smoke, green tea, and chocolate. Just past the stage of primary fruit flavors, it drinks beautifully, but can certainly be cellared for another decade at least.",Corliss Estates 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
5021,"There aren't very many Cabernets from the small Chalk Hill appellation in eastern Sonoma County. This one is excellent, a worthy follow-up to the winery's 2007, offering smooth and rich tannins, with elaborate blackberry, cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. New oak plays a dominant role, but it should recede as the wine integrates over time. Give it 6–8 years in the cellar.",Creō 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)
5022,"Goldschmidt has held this single-vineyard Cabernet back for more than five years, an expensive proposition. And it needs even more time. Although it's magnificent, the parts haven't yet come together. It's massive in blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors, and the tannins are pure Alexander Valley—soft and herbal—but the oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Put it in the cellar until at least 2018, and it could go far beyond that.",Goldschmidt 2007 Plus Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
5023,"This classy Syrah opens with a note of pretty funkiness, wrapped around stiff, tight, rather herbal flavors. The berry flavor is ripe but in no way jammy. Here the emphasis is on nuance, earthiness and herbal details.",Gramercy 2010 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5024,"There's a lot of lees influence on this wine, which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel. It's dense in tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey notes, with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. A dry, complex, multilayered wine, this will gain traction with 2–4 years in the cellar.",Marimar Estate 2010 Don Miguel Vineyard La Masía Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
5025,"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious, oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors, it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years.",Shafer 2008 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
5026,"This is pure Cabernet—tight, tannic and terroir-driven. It has a dense mix of fruit, rock, earth and herb flavors that are nicely integrated, with a full palate and fine complexity and density. A little more barrel toast would put the icing on the cake.",K Vintners 2009 Stoneridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)
5027,"The vineyard straddles Atlas Peak and the Pritchard Hill region, and this beautiful Cabernet shows its terroir in the firm tannins and ripe, complex flavors. It's high in alcohol, which gives it some heat, and it is rich in flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and cassis liqueur. Give it an hour or two in the decanter and drink now.",Krupp Brothers 2008 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5028,"Lush, plush and absolutely delicious, this shows a range of softly approachable flavors, including blackberry, cherry, currant, anise, cocoa, mineral, buttery oak and spice. The tannins are thick but finely ground. It's firmly set in the modern cult style and may not be an ager, but it sure impresses now.",Constant 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5029,"Quietly, Hewitt flies below the radar, often producing Cabernets that, while not cheap, rival their pricier competition. Consider their '09 a deal. It's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, offering waves of black cherry jam, mocha, licorice and smoky oak. You can drink this lovely wine now, but it should develop in the bottle over the next 10 years.",Hewitt 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
5030,"From the acclaimed Champoux vineyard, this puts the purple fruit in a wrap of pretty baking spices. Barrel aging adds cocoa and coffee, while the acidity is sufficient to keep the wine from feeling too tannic. Another couple of years of bottle age—or brisk decanting—should put it at its peak.",Sineann 2012 Champoux Vineyard Petit Verdot (Columbia Valley (WA))
5031,"Very rich, this ripe and rounded wine is typical of the powerful 2010 vintage. It's dense and concentrated, packed with black plum and sweet berry fruits. It shows a dense structure along with juicy fruits. It could be over the top, but the acidity and tannins hold it back. Drink from 2018.",Château de Ferrand 2010  Saint-Émilion
5032,"A wine that is rich in both tannins and ripe fruit. The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the concentration of the wine, with spice and black berry fruits that are given an extra richness by the intense dark plums. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2018.",Château Haut-Logat 2010  Haut-Médoc
5033,"Made from young vines, this is the second wine of Suduiraut. It has young, honeyed character, with a ripe, opulent texture that lays bitter orange fruits over drier noble rot flavors. It is so delicious now, but will be better from 2017.",Château Suduiraut 2010 Castelnau de Suduiraut  (Sauternes)
5034,"This Syrah-based wine is dense, concentrated and seriously ageworthy. It is weighted by concentrated black fruit, with solid tannic structure and fine acidity on the finish. Drink after 2016.",Cortes de Cima 2011 Incógnito Syrah (Alentejano)
5035,"Impressively concentrated for a Pinot Blanc, it offers intense spice as well as crisp apple flavors. It's bright, with good acidity as well as a rich and rounded aftertaste.",Domaine Ostertag 2013 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
5036,"Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture. It shows the heat of the volcanic soil of Ragen de Thann Grand Cru in its rich fruits and ripe structure. It does need aging, so drink from 2017.",Domaine Schoffit 2011 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Riesling (Alsace)
5037,"Not overly sweet, this offers a spicy character on top of a touch of honey and fresh lemon flavors. It's surprisingly and attractively delicate for a Gewurztraminer, and ready to drink now.",Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Kessler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
5038,"Distinctive and generous, this white Rhône-style wine is made from Sierra Foothills grapes by a seasoned Napa winemaker. It tastes like vanilla, hazelnuts and pears, has a creamy texture, feels layered with fruit and spice notes, and has good acidity balanced by richness of flavor.",Elyse 2012 L'Ingenue Naggiar Vineyard White (Sierra Foothills)
5039,"This has a brighter yellow color than most of its peers, more body, riper fruit flavors and—unusual for this variety in America—probably some oak influence. Rather full bodied, but well-balanced and very smooth, it combines peach and pear flavors with a hefty mouthfeel.",FEL 2013 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)
5040,"A classic Napa Valley Chardonnay, this is smooth, rich, balanced and well composed. Flowery aromas of honeysuckle open the way for lemon curd and ripe apple to compete with a depth of crème brûlée character that provides plenty of complexity, with additional accents of honey and spice.",Franciscan 2012 Cuvée Sauvage Chardonnay (Carneros)
5041,"Attractively priced, this Cab—with 5% Petit Verdot—offers meaty bacon and smoky oak character around sizable tannins, black currant, black licorice and a finishing dust of mocha.",Gibbs 2010 Obsidian Block Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
5042,"Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove.",Greyscale 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5043,"From a warm vintage, this blend is ripe yet still balanced, with aromas of prune, blackberry, tree bark and leather. The palate is saturated and broad, boasting flavors of dark, baked, black fruit accented by pepper and chocolate on the finish. Drink now.",Lapostolle 2012 Canto de Apalta Cellar Selection Red (Rapel Valley)
5044,"Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family. She leaves her own mark on this structured, silky, robust and rich Cabernet, bright in red cranberry and clove. Firehouse Vineyard is on the winery estate and given to floral and herbal notes, both of which suggest themselves slowly here.",Piña 2011 Firehouse Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
5045,"This full-bodied wine offers classic Nebbiolo aromas of underbrush, black cherry, leather and a whiff of baking spices. It's still young, delivering raspberry, clove, cinnamon and grilled herb framed by tightly woven tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink after 2019.",Produttori del Barbaresco 2009 Pora Riserva  (Barbaresco)
5046,"This is a modestly priced Napa Cabernet that's feral and brambly, the flavors well-composed and soft in black plum and black cherry. It's well balanced and structured, with ample tannins and length on the finish.",Renteria 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5047,"Warmed croissant yeastiness matches up with sea salt and lemon butter on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Santa Barbara Winery. The salinity carries on the palate, with apple pie and butterscotch presenting a nicely oaked but not overdone palate.",Santa Barbara Winery 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
5048,"Fruity frills of strawberry surround a core of black New Mexican chiles, with cinnamon and clove emerging the longer one sniffs. There's nice tension between the fruit flavors and the nearly bell pepper greenness. Throw a chill on it and serve with barbecued pork.",Still Waters 2010 Estate Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles)
5049,"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything.",Taken Wine Co. 2013 Complicated Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
5050,"A rich and medium sweet wine, full of spice, lychees and ripe fruits. There is a tangy texture, a strong sense of minerality as well as herb, yellow fruits and nutmeg flavors. It is still young and needs time. Drink from 2017.",Boeckel 2012 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
5051,"With rich melon aromas, ripe apple flavors and a soothing, almost soft texture, this wants some rich, sophisticated cooking to go with it, like sautéed fish with a classic French sauce. Subtle acidity keeps the notes of almond and apple lingering on the finish.",Wildhurst 2013 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
5052,"Aromas of cherry and vanilla continue to the palate alongside notes of toffee, smoked meat and roasted red pepper. A well-balanced wine, with flavors that are equal parts fruity and savory, the finish boasts lingering tannins and bright acidity. Fine Terroir Selections, Misa Imports.",Ixsir 2009 Grande Réserve Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Lebanon)

The palate is led by tobacco-laced zing, opening with boysenberry flavors, and finishing with decent acidity and mouth-coating tannins.",Mount Eden Vineyards 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
5054,"The Reserva version of Mural makes a powerful statement. Dark in color and packed with concentrated fruit, it is full of tannins as well as brooding black-plum flavors. Spice and juicy acidity complete the ensemble. It's a solid wine that needs to age to soften the tannic structure. Drink from 2017.",Quinta do Portal 2011 Mural Reserva Red (Douro)
5055,"This wine is a fine exposition of the structure and density of a serious Douro wine. A field blend, it is packed with dark berry fruits and sweet tannins, with a strong mineral element that reflects the tough schist of the vineyards. It's drinkable now, but the wine will be better in 2016.",Quinta do Sagrado 2008 VT '08 Red (Douro)
5056,"Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity.",Robert Biale 2012 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
5057,"This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice. It's medium bodied, with a thick, textured feel showing good weight and intensity to the fruit flavors alongside well-balanced acidity. A uniquely styled wine without an easy comparison in the region.",Savage Grace 2013 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA))
5058,"Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs. It's silky soft in feel with a dazzling sense of texture and purity with little apparent oak influence.",Savage Grace 2013 Dineen Vineyard Malbec (Rattlesnake Hills)
5059,"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering. The finish carries a suggestion of chalk, more in the sense of minerality than any artificial dryness.",Arbor Crest 2012 Five Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
5060,"Sanguine and brawny, it's concentrated in dark plum and blueberry fruit, with an earthy element teasing around the edges. The finish is marked by power and grip.",Genius Wines 2009 Creò Clajeux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)
5061,"This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish. Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.",Happy Canyon Vineyard 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
5062,"Quite why Smart Dog is a good name for a wine is a mystery. The wine itself a rich, soft Syrah with attractive ripe blackberry and plum flavors and soft, finely integrated tannins. It's an enjoyable wine that's ready to drink.",J. Portugal Ramos 2012 Smart Dog Syrah (Alentejano)

5066,"Almost like a salad in your glass, this fresh-tasting, dry white wine smells like sugar snap peas and just-picked greens. It tastes snappy and crisp with parsley and thyme flavors, and has a refreshing texture.",Berryessa Gap 2013 Iberian Series Verdelho (Yolo County)
5067,"Spunky, youthful aromas of wild berry and currant are aggressive but fresh in style. This is a juicy, forward, bright Malbec with boysenberry flavors followed by a short wave of bitter chocolate and toast. It finishes in the same style.",Bodega Norton 2012 Barrel Select Malbec (Mendoza)
5068,"There is a strong barnyard aroma here, although the palate is cleaner and more modern. With rich tannins and a dark plum character, it's ripe and structured. There is a strong mineral element, giving the wine power and density. Drink from 2016.",Borges 2011 Lello Red (Douro)
5069,"A tasty, lighter style of Pinot Noir, it offers fresh cherry and raspberry aromas, juicy fruit flavors and a delicate texture. There's enough complexity to keep you coming back for another sip.",Castle Rock 2012 Pinot Noir (Mendocino)
5070,"This ripe wine opens with a fragrance of mature red and black berry, clove and black pepper. These carry over to the warm palate alongside brooding and tightly-knit tannins. It has a forward character and soft acidity so enjoy this now and over the next few years.",Taliano 2011 Ad Altiora  (Barbaresco)

5073,"Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torrontés. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torrontés that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits. A fresh, lively but simple finish confirms the wine's refreshment potential.",Trivento 2013 Amado Sur Torrontés-Viognier-Chardonnay White (Mendoza)
5074,"Graham cracker and lemon aromas weave into the brioche and porcini undertones. Graceful in weight, this bears a frothy bead that lends the palate tension. Aged on lees for 36 months.",Trump 2009 SP Blanc de Noir Brut Pinot Noir (Monticello)

5077,"The wine is all juicy fruit, black cherries with just a modicum of tannin to hold it together. It's fresh, ripe and immediately attractive. Ready to drink now, but with those tannins it should also age 2016–2017.",Château du Coudray Montpensier 2013 Le Grand Bouqueteau  (Chinon)
5078,"This herbaceous wine is fresh, steely and crisp. Bright acidity cuts strongly through the lively texture, giving apples, lemon and pink grapefruit. Developing fast, it is ready to drink.",Château Lafont Menaut 2012  Pessac-Léognan

5080,"Bold and fruity, this saignée-style rosé is 75% Syrah and 25% Pinot Noir. Tart, tangy, primary fruit flavors of watermelon, strawberry and cranberry fill the mouth, turning just a little bit sour in the finish.",Coeur de Terre 2013 Rustique Rosé (Willamette Valley)
5081,"This crisp, clean Chardonnay is a good find for $20. Fruity with a suggestive note of caramel on the nose, it delivers a taste of citrus and green apple on the palate that evolves into a satisfying finish that's entirely tropical.",Decoy 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
5082,"Snappy, dry red-fruit and citrus aromas are a good opening. The palate is fresh and bouncy, with punchy pomegranate and grapefruit flavors. A zesty finish with mild citrus and nectarine flavors is par for the course.",Enanzo 2013 Garnacha Rosado (Navarra)
5083,"This wine is heavily spiced from its wood aging. Fresher fruit flavors do come through to give black currants, bright acidity as well as firmer fruit structure. The wine still needs time, so drink from 2016.",Etienne de Tauriac 2010  Côtes de Bourg
5084,"An amalgam of 85% Tannat, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this sports leather and blackberry aromas. The medium-bodied palate comes with tight, finely plaited tannins, and the boosted acids give the wine spine.",Fabbioli Cellars 2011 Tannat (Virginia)
5085,"This white wine from Serbia has aromas of caramelized pineapple and elderflower. It is lively and energetic, with flavors of Japanese apple and ripe pineapple.",Milijan Jelić 2011 Morava (Pocerina)
5086,"An unusual medley of aromas include orange peel, dill, mint, thyme, espresso and oak. The palate offers coffee, toasted oak and sugary vanilla but it doesn't have much fruit richness. Astringent tannins give a short, bitter finish that dries out the mouth.",Parusso 2010 Bussia  (Barolo)
5087,"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture.",Pezat 2012  Bordeaux Blanc
5088,"This starts off with promisingly vibrant aromas of passion fruit and pink grapefruit, but seems a bit weighty and thickly textured in the mouth. The fruit remains the bold centerpiece, while the finish shows some alcoholic warmth.",Plantagenet 2011 Hazard Hill Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Western Australia)
5089,"There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries.",Purlieu 2012 Le Pich Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
5090,"Nice and dry, with some smooth tannins framing berry, cherry and oak flavors. Serve it at big parties, at the beach, wherever. Nobody will complain.",Robert Mondavi 2011 Private Selection Meritage (Central Coast)
5091,"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",SuLei 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5092,"On the nose, this Cab delivers a mix of vinegar, rubber and jumpy berry aromas. The palate is smooth but bland and soft, while flavors of licorice, prune and herbal notes finish easy.",Valle Secreto 2010 First Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley)
5093,"Lots of early-drinking charm in this Pinot Noir. It's light and silky, with a modest alcohol level that makes it easy to drink. The raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors are delicious.",Laetitia 2011 Clone 113 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
5094,"Scratchy berry aromas come with a hint of sweet-smelling plastic, but overall this bargain-priced Cab is good and welcoming. The palate has a pure, medium-bodied feel, while flavors of baked berry, cassis and chocolate finish with a mocha taste and mild heat.",Mancura 2011 Guardián Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
5095,"Maray Chardonnay is crisp and mineral-driven on the nose, but not overly fruity. This is lean-bodied, with cidery, tangy acidity and dominating flavors of limestone-influenced citrus and stone fruits. It's a modest Chardonnay with finesse but not a whole lot of flavor.",Maray 2012 Limited Edition Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)
5096,"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.",O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
5097,"Mint and eucalyptus flavors show strongly in this wood-aged, polished, smoky wine. The fruit suggests black plums, damsons and berries. Give the wine 3–4 years.",Jean-Michel Cazes 2011 Michel Lynch Bio  (Bordeaux)
5098,"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, this Cabernet—which includes healthy doses of Malbec and Syrah—is light in style with notes of herbs and currant. With the oak (21% new American) dialed back, it's fresh and direct.",Waterbrook 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
5099,"This Chard's oak accents pineapple and lemon fruit flavors. It's dry yet honeyed, that paradox of Chardonnay, with a good burst of citrusy acids for brightness.",Wild Horse 2011 Unbridled Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
5100,"Despite showing dusty plum and cherry aromas, this comes across lean on the bouquet, a defining characteristic that's confirmed on the palate via zesty, crisp acids and raw, tangy, herbal red-fruit flavors. A dry finish turns hot, an appropriate ending to this tightly wound Pinot Noir.",Errazuriz 2011 Max Reserva Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
5101,"This perfumed, juicy wine exhibts attractive red plum and blackberry flavors. Touches of herbs show a fragrant side to the wine, while acidity acts as a foil to the ripe fruits. Ready to drink now. Screwcap.",Fischer 2009 Classic St. Laurent (Thermenregion)
5102,"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't fully ripe yet it's dry and crisp, with a mouthwatering cleanness. There's an edge to the Meyer lemon, lime, green melon and vanilla flavors.",Baehner Fournier 2012 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
5103,"An aromatically appealing wine with notes of cinnamon, chocolate and cherry. Unfortunately, it's quite tart with grainy, somewhat bitter tannins.",Canoe Ridge 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
5104,"Despite cold conditions in 2011, this Pinot is dark in color and full on the nose, where heavy, raisiny black-fruit aromas hold court. Flavors of toasty oak, plum, berry and raisin finish peppery, oaky and with vanilla and prune notes. Drink now.",Casas del Bosque 2011 Pequeñas Producciones Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
5105,"In Spain, Albariño is usually a steely, bone dry, sea-inflected white wine. Here it is made in an off-dry style, with 10 g/L residual sugar. The sweetness masks any apparent varietal specificity, resulting in a pleasant, but generic white wine.",Castillo De Feliciana 2012 Albariño (Columbia Valley (WA))
5106,"The winery doesn't tell us what the blend is, but it tastes vaguely Rhônish. It's dry, velvety and forward in cherry pie, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. It's a little hot in alcohol. Drink up.",Communication Block 2010 Lampyridae Vineyards Red (Mount Veeder)
5107,"Minty aromas rest on top of scratchy raspberry scents. This feels a touch raw and choppy, with grating tannins pumping up herbal berry flavors that come with a carob-influenced aftertaste. A short, lightly herbal finish feels good and solid.",Emiliana 2011 Natura Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
5108,Raspberry jam and oak are the flavors of this drink-me-now wine. Brisk acidity gives it a mouthwatering cleanness. The single-clone angle has resulted in a certain one-dimensionality.,Fess Parker 2011 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
5109,"One of the classic, simple, attractive Grüners to come out of Austria, this brings forward lively green fruits, a touch of spice and crisp acidity. It's totally ready to drink. Screwcap.",Markus Huber 2012 Hugo Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
5110,"This is a soft, creamy, strawberry- and caramel-flavored wine with lively acidity and a very crisp, citrusy aftertaste. It's an ideal apéritif-style wine, perfect for the summer.",Markus Huber NV Hugo Rosé Sparkling Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt)
5111,"This straddles the border between an off-dry table wine and a dessert wine. It's crisp in acidity, with candied orange, golden apricot and honey flavors. You could certainly drink it with cookies and fruits, but it's just dry enough to stand up to squash baked with brown sugar, and a piece of grilled chicken.",Martin & Weyrich 2011 Allegro Moscato (California)
5112,"This full-bodied Barbera has ripe black-cherry aromas nuanced with toast and coffee notes. The palate is structured, with dark fruit flavors, pepper, toasted oak and espresso notes, but the drying wood tannins result in an abrupt finish. Grape Expectations and Massanois Imports.",Pico Maccario 2010 Epico  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
5113,"This is a straightforward and pleasant Barbera exhibiting ripe dark-fruit flavors, spice and fresh acidity. Cries out for food, and will pair beautifully with soups, pastas and white meats. Grape Expectations and Massanois Imports.",Pico Maccario 2012 Lavignone  (Barbera d'Asti)
5114,"Pinot Grigios like this helped make the variety one of America's most popular wines. While it's basically dry and crisp in acidity, it offers jammy green apple, lemon and lime Lifesaver candy and vanilla notes that appeal to consumers.",Robert Mondavi 2012 Private Selection Pinot Grigio (Central Coast)
5115,"This is the inaugural vintage for this producer, a husband-and-wife team in partnership with winemaker Maayan Koschitzky, who also works with Philippe Melka.

Mint, black olive, blackberry and cigar highlight the sensual texture, enriched in dark chocolate.",Brilliant Mistake 2013 Taylor Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
5116,"There is something both earthy and berry fruited on the nose: both dried and fresh fruit shine with richness. There is a totally unusual, lovely bitter edge to this fruit, like a marzipan richness at the edge of tart but with ripe fruit. Take this into your treasure chest of vinous curiosities: It more than deserves its place. This is dry but rich, tart but generous, and comes with its very own strong and forceful personality.",Johanneshof Reinisch 2015 Satzing Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)
5117,"Softened by 10% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this is a medium-bodied, elegant wine, with highlights of coffee, cedar and cherry-vanilla. Classic elements of cedar and dried herb complement firm, solid tannin.",Les Belles Collines 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5118,"Candied cranberry and grape meet with light nutmeg, gingersnap cookies and wet slate on the rich, interesting nose of this wine by Lompoc-based Brian Loring.

5119,"Rhubarb, ripe cherry and wet slate show on this wine, one of the many higher-end, single-vineyard expressions that winemaker Paul Clifton makes for the Hahn family. Hearty beet juice and lots of star anise show on the sip that is redolent with dark, wild berries.",Lucienne 2014 Hook Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
5120,"Baked black cherry, rare roast beef and light sage aromas show on the dynamic, earthy nose of this bottling by Winemaker Paul Clifton. Garrigue is prominent on the tip of the sip, with strong but not overripe black cherry and plum flavors. These lead into forest floor, juniper, pine needle and mulling spice on the finish.",Lucienne 2014 Smith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
5121,"Concentrated, well structured and not too full bodied, this is an almost architectural wine in how it fills out the palate and clings to the taste buds. It has an appetizing texture due to fine-grained tannins, a sense of ripeness without overripeness, plus deep and layered fruit, coffee and black-pepper nuances.",Lynch Wines 2013 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
5122,"From a block planted in 1910 consisting of hearty portions of mixed blacks, this wine is abundantly floral in rose petals, with a plummy core dusted in smoky oak. The tannin structure is sizable, while the wine is full of leather, cigar box and black pepper accents that weave within the ripe fruit.",Armida 2014 Tina's Block Maple Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
5123,"There are a number of intriguing notions on the nose: There is something nutty and rich, something mellow and yeasty, something green and lively, all tinged with the juicy ripeness of yellow-stone fruit. Not one of these impressions dominates, all of them catch your attention in a merry haze of flavors delivered against a firm backbone of freshness and concentration.",Bernhard Ott 2015 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Wagram)
5124,"Named after the medieval rulers of the village, this cru wine is firm and structured in the solid style of the appellation. It has rich black cherry and black-plum fruits that come with juicy acidity. At the same time, the tannins and the dry core promise considerable aging. Drink from 2019.",Trenel Fils 2015 Les Capitans  (Juliénas)
5125,"An oxidative style of Chardonnay seems to match the old-vine character in this bottling that is a nutty yellow in color and shows crushed hazelnuts, dried lemon, sourdough and croissant on the nose. Lemon rinds, tangerine and walnut flavors appear on the sip, which is rich and nutty but not unctuous.",Wolff 2014 Old Vines Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
5126,"The nose is tightly closed, yet there is the suspicion of fine fruit. The grippy palate brims with peppery dark-plum fruit and very fine distinct tannins that give this a taut, rigid frame that still needs to relax. This is unusual in so far that it is a Cabernet Franc from Austria, grown on slate. It works well: The tannic structure and fruit are fully expressed. This needs bottle age and will blossom into a far more relaxed and fruitful wine. Drink 2020–2030.",Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Gillesberg Cabernet Franc (Burgenland)
5127,"This sultry, big-boned wine offers deft aspects of black pepper and dried herb atop a softly layered touch of brown sugar. Richness is there, as is a voluptuous flirtatiousness, yet it remains dry and dusty on the palate and classically varietal.",Haraszthy 2013 Indian Springs Ranch Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
5128,"Very subtle notions of nettle and ripe, yellow mirabelle plum play on the nose. The palate displays the same juicy notions and bounces with the ample fruit of 2015, tempered by spicy grapefruit zestiness. This offers a wonderful interplay of ripeness and just the right amount of refreshing tartness.",Hiedler 2015 Ried Schnekenbichl Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
5129,"The Okanagan has the capability to produce delicate, almost ethereal Pinot Noirs, and this fine example proves the point. Fragrant and feminine, its strawberry and cherry fruit ripe enough to suggest fresh pastry, it's simply delicious, offering complexity and persistence as well as immediate enjoyment.",Burrowing Owl 2014 Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley)
5130,"Owned by Beaune merchant Louis Jadot, this cru estate produces some impressive wines. While its alcohol is excessive for a Beaujolais, it wears its power well. The black plum fruit and tannins from wood aging that are still very present will soften over the next year to give a rich generous wine with a style that is Burgundian rather than traditional Beaujolais. Drink from 2018.",Château des Jacques 2015 Côte du Py  (Morgon)
5131,"Initially this smells foxy, with jumpy untamed berry and plum notes racing across the nose. After the aromas come around, this is hard and choppy on the palate, while herbal black-plum and carob flavors finish more lushly than before, but still fairly tannic. Drink through 2023.",Concha y Toro 2013 Don Melchor Puente Alto Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto)
5132,"The northernmost of the Beaujolais cru villages can produce wines that are Burgundian in their structure. This wine fits that profile well with its dark tannins and rich concentration. Densely textured with both black-cherry fruit and a dry core, the wine is taking its time to develop. Drink from late 2017 or 2018.",Domaine des Chers 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Saint-Amour)
5133,A touch of passion fruit haunts the nose. The palate is juicy with mirabelle plums and lively lemon and orange notes. There is zesty textured concentration and a wonderful purity of flavor. This is exciting and has lots of drive with a lip-smacking finish.,Forstreiter 2015 Schiefer Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
5134,"Dark, dense with fruit flavor and thickly tannic, this full-bodied wine is a monument to concentration, ripeness and richness. Massive tannins are matched by huge jammy fruit, with a sense of layering and depth that is impressive and satisfying to experience.",Freakshow 2014 Red (Lodi)
5135,"A blend of Syrah (68%), Grenache (29%) and Viognier, this wine brings pungent, directly appealing aromas of smoked meat, blue fruit, black olive, orange peel and high-toned flowers. The blue and black-fruit and smoked-meat flavors are silky and well constructed with a finish that lingers.",Gård 2014 Vaucluse Lawrence Vineyards Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
5136,"The producer sources from three sites, each vineyard-designate worthy: Cleary Ranch and Rayhill Vineyard in Freestone, and Stiling Vineyard in Russian River Valley. Together they sing, coaxing spicy white pepper and clove from the grapes while a velvety texture of firm tannin provides support. Raspberry and baked cherry highlight the fruit flavors.",Blue Rock 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
5137,"Made from 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petit Verdot and 20% Cabernet Franc, this has inviting aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, forest floor and a whiff of cedar. The dense, polished palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove, licorice and tobacco. Firm, refined tannins provide support.",Brancaia 2012 Ilatraia Red (Toscana)
5138,"It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020.",Osprey's Dominion 2013 Carmenère (North Fork of Long Island)
5139,"The producer sources primarily from its historic Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard for this wine, a rich expression of the variety opaque in color. Meat, black pepper, leather and tobacco give it a velvety lushness and concentration buoyed by complex, savory components. The lengthy finish is all about bittersweet chocolate.",Gundlach Bundschu 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
5140,"Spicy aromas of balsam wood, tobacco and sawmill work well with ripe but reserved red-berry scents. Tight, tannic but also fresh as opposed to drying, this Cabernet from a cool year delivers a classic set of herbal berry, plum and wood spice flavors. A ripped finish is dry and oaky now, with core fruit resting for the future. Drink 2018–2028.",Koyle 2013 Royale Los Lingues Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
5141,"The merest touch of apricot caresses the vanilla and hazelnut notes of fine oak. The palate, on the other hand, conveys power and concentration, held tight and taut by lemon freshness. This will take a little while in bottle to unfold and should entice lovers of Chardonnay with its combination of bright freshness and lush fruit.",Anton Bauer 2015 Kreuzgang Chardonnay (Wagram)
5142,"A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose. The palate tightens up into underripe cherry, thyme, marjoram and bay leaf, with very dry elderberry fruit tones.",Baker & Brain 2013 Pendulum Red (Monterey County)
5143,"Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate.",Ballentine 2014 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley)
5144,"A curious mix of roasted smokiness and red fruits makes for an appetizing autumnal nose. The red fruit underneath these flavors is beautifully pure and speaks of raspberry and wild strawberries. The wonderfully refreshing tartness zips across the palate like a bright streak of light and gives freshness, direction and poise to everything. The flavors are lasting and long.",Bründlmayer 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Niederösterreich)
5145,"A rich, opulent wine at an unbelievable price, this Chard has layers of ripe peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and a lush overlay of toasty oak. The wonderfully creamy texture leads to a long, spicy finish. Despite the statewide appellation, this is as good as many regional Chardonnays.",Esser Cellars 2001 Chardonnay (California)
5146,"This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot is young, rambunctious and tight, but also very interesting. The aromas of chocolate, clove, pepper and black plum do the trick: you are drawn in. Intense flavors of cherry, plum, cassis and pepper, and a finish of piquant spices and oak are equally satisfying. Based on how this wine responded to air we say give it a few years to settle down.",Cana's Feast 1999 Red (Red Mountain)
5147,"This is a very modern style of wine, with generous new wood and super-ripe fruit flavors, balancing with polished solid tannins. Very international in style, it is good, but could come from anywhere.",Château Pontet-Canet 2000  Pauillac
5148,"This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape.",Clos Fourtet 2000  Saint-Émilion
5149,"Medium and smooth in the mouth, Jacob's Creek's top Chard (check?) has stone and star fruits at its core, and a sleek mineral quality. Creamy on the nose, but with a lively lime streak that keeps it crisp. Finishes medium-long with drying minerals.",Jacob's Creek 2000 Limited Release Chardonnay (Padthaway)
5150,"Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting. The build-out is well done, tannins firm and moderately ripe, fruit flavors Bordeaux-like. Right now it's a bit monolithic, tasty enough, but without the textural interest that most Abacela wines display.",Abacela 2006 Claret (Southern Oregon)
5151,"Although there's no oak on this wine, it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache. There are also percentages of Chardonnay and Pinot Gris that fatten Sauvignon's minerals and limes. Acidity is mouthwateringly high. This isn't a great wine, but it is a unique one, especially for Santa Rita Hills.",Babcock 2009 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sta. Rita Hills)
5152,"A steal for six bucks; the nose is floral and black, but under control. Meanwhile, the palate is bouncy, round and balanced, with juicy black plum and wild berry flavors. Clean and solid.",Borsao 2009 Viña Borgia Grenache (Campo de Borja)
5153,"Very bright and acidic, with the savory taste of a sour lemondrop candy. If you're sensitive to acidity you'll find it tart. But it's deliciously layered, with tiers of buttered toast, vanilla and spice.",Brophy Clark 2008 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
5154,"This is a good, sound, everyday Chardonnay. It's very dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with mineral-laded flavors of lemons, limes, apples and pineapples, touched with vanilla and buttered toast.",Carmel Road 2008 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
5155,"You'll really love this simple and clean white wine from sunny Tuscany. The aromas here are crisp and fragrant, recalling peach, apricot and pear. The wine is zippy in the mouth but it also awards enough natural structure for tuna or sushi.",Castello Montaúto 2008  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
5156,"The 2007 Hickinbotham features attractive scents of ground spices, leather and red cherries, but doesn't seem to have the richness and depth of CH's other Grenaches this year. Tart cherry-berry fruit fades into finely textured tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Clarendon Hills 2007 Hickinbotham Grenache (Clarendon)
5157,"Hints at cedar, spice and dark fruit on the nose, then turns unexpectedly tart on the palate. The tannins are soft, leaving the acidity to provide a counterbalance to the ripe fruit. Drink now.",D'Arenberg 2008 The Custodian Grenache (McLaren Vale)
5158,"Bright fruit freshness dominates this wine. The fruit is pure, vivid. light and crisp. The acidity is important here, driving the wine in a mineral direction.",Domaine Specht 2008 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
5159,"A solid, straightforward, all-purpose Pinot Gris, this offers firm and spicy pear and apple fruit, some crisp phenolics giving it a racy edge, and a little bite to the back of the palate. It has the acidity to stand up to creamy pasta sauces or soft cheeses.",Evergreen Vineyards 2008 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
5160,"Black pepper is the star of this bone-dry, full-bodied young wine, in both the aroma and the flavor. Below that are bold notes of black currants, plums and leather. The tannins are hard, giving it a mouth-stinging astringency. Your best bet is to cellar it for 3–4 years, but it's somewhat risky.",Fess Parker 2007 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
5161,"Light strawberry and black cherry fruit is the story here, backed with decent acidity. Tannins are dark and well-structured, so the wine keeps its balance. Though it does not have the weight or depth of Washington Syrahs, or the sweet berry flavors of California, it is soundly made, drinking well, fruit forward, and a good choice for warm weather sipping.",J. Scott Cellars 2007 Del Rio Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley)
5162,"A little gritty and tough on the nose, with hard strawberry and kirsch aromas. The palate is voluminous and foamy, with flavors of burnt blood orange and grilled pink grapefruit. Yes, there's a hard, burnt element to the wine, but this being Pinot Noir from Penedès that's to be expected.",Juvé y Camps NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Cava)
5163,"Light, young vine fruit flavors mix strawberry and rhubarb, with a tangy, citrus component underscoring the midpalate. It gets a little more interesting in the finish, which brings in seed flavors and a lingering, orange juicy aftertaste.",Luminous Hills 2008 Estate Grown Pinot Noir
5164,"Crisp, natural and lightly salinic on the nose, with medium weight, good freshness and solid peach and citrus flavors. This is a standard but nicely done Rioja rosé with a pithy finish and just the right edge to it. Drink liberally with appetizers and you shouldn't go wrong.",Marqués de Cáceres 2009 Rosé (Rioja)
5165,"Uccelliera regularly produces powerhouse Brunellos. This Rosso evidently represents a change of pace because instead of power and intensity, you get ethereal aromas of wild berry and green spice. There's also an unexpected touch of sour cherry on the close.",Uccelliera 2008  Rosso di Montalcino
5166,"A good, dry Cabernet whose fruit flavors are balanced with rich tannins. Offers upfront flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and cocoa. Good price, considering the elegance",Valley of the Moon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
5167,"Not very Chardonnay-like, more like a Viognier or Pinot Gris with its aromatic floral, tropical fruit, citrus, melon and spice aromas and flavors. Still, it's very tasty, and dry as well, with a crisp spine of minerally acidity.",Villa Andretti 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
5168,"This is a gorgeously perfumed Riesling, chock-full of white flowers and ripe, juicy stonefruit, but not at all cloying. Dry on the palate, it exhibits elegant peach and apricot flavors that lead to a long, lingering finish marked by lime peel and a hint of chalk.",Wagner 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
5169,"Harvested at 22.6 degrees brix, this bright and spicy Dolcetto does not reach too far. It's tart, with fruit flavors that suggest wild berries and pomegranate, and tannins that are firm but never green. A fine quaffing wine.",Abacela 2008 Dolcetto (Umpqua Valley)
5170,"Opens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.",Bodegas San Prudencio 2007 Envite Crianza  (Rioja)
5171,"Even for a Mount Veeder Cab, this one's pretty tannic. It also seems very oaky, with lots of caramelized, charred wood. Somewhere underneath it all are blackberries and black currants that are sweetly ripe. Your best bet is to cellar it, but its future is uncertain given the initial irregularities.",Brandlin 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
5172,"There's a meaty, ripe aspect to the aromas here that recall black cherry and smoked ham. But there's also an edgy green tone that lends a slightly bitter impression in the mouth.",Canneta 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
5173,"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California. The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries, tart, spicy and quite quaffable.",Cathedral Ridge 2008 Necessity Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR))
5174,"Bright and woodsy, this Syrah-dominant red is intriguing for its tapestry of earth and mushroom flavors interwoven with mixed berry fruit. There's enough acidity in the medium, yeast-scented finish to stand up to hearty red meats. Drink up.",Domaine Saint Andrieu 2007 Red (Côtes de Provence)
5175,"Typical light and fresh Grüner, with an attractive burst of lemon acidity as well as a creamy texture. Delicious, crisp wine. Screwcap.",Domäne Wachau 2009 Terrassen Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
5176,"A blend assembled from several vineyards, Kumeu River's 2010 Estate Chardonnay is a medium-bodied, plushly textured wine.

5177,"This Pinot bears only the simple regional Carneros appellation, but it has the rich texture and complex flavors of a vineyard-designated wine. Absolutely delicious, with raspberry, red cherry, mocha and red-licorice flavors that go on and on into a long, spicy finish. Drink this lovely wine over the next few years.",Renteria 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
5178,"A wonderfully drinkable Pinot Noir, this wine shows the brisk acidity and long hangtime flavors of the Sonoma Coast. The fruit got exceptionally ripe, so the raspberries, cherries and persimmons are as sweet as jam. Yet the finish is dry and firm.",Renteria 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
5179,"Still young, hard and sharp-edged, the wine reveals dark flavors of charred toast and espresso, set around a core of tight cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's built to age, and has some pleasing mocha and spice notes rounding out the finish.",Rex Hill 2011 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
5180,"This structured wine opens with quintessential Sangiovese aromas of violet and black berries punctuated with whiffs of leather and balsamic herbs. The palate delivers a core of black cherry accented with mint, black pepper and licorice notes that add depth.

Soilair Selections, Vineyard Road, WineCraft.",Riecine 2011  Chianti Classico
5181,"This is the winery's best Cabernet Sauvignon in years. It has classic black currant flavor, enhanced by smoky oak, and feels distinguished in the mouth. It's young, but should begin to mellow and show its stuff by 2017.",Rutherford Hill 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

5184,"Rich in wild cherry, raspberry, black cherry and white pepper, this delicious wine offers all the juicy fruit, freshness, minerality and supple tannins that make a young, well-made Morellino so attractive.

5186,"A fruity wine, it's packed with citrus, freshly peeled apples and white peaches. Acidity cuts through the ripeness, giving total freshness at this stage. It's a wine to be drunk for its fruitiness now, or aged until 2018 for more complex flavors.",Château Moncontour 2012 Sec  (Vouvray)

It's really lovely now, with brisk acidity brightening the fruit, and should continue to mellow over until 2020.",En Garde 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
5190,"Made with Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this wine begins with typical Sangiovese aromas of tilled soil, leather, spice and ripe berries.

It's starting to show tertiary flavors of flint and fig but will maintain well for another few years at least. Drink through 2018.",Fattoria di Montemaggio 2008  Chianti Classico
5191,"This is a woody, oak-dominated Malbec, but it's also ripe and well made. Aromas of sawdust, vanilla and toast support raw berry essence.

It's delicious now, but should develop well through 2020.",Dr. Loosen 2009 Eiswein Riesling (Mosel)
5194,"So bright and zingy in acidity, and so ripe in tangerine, mango, lime fruit and honeysuckle, that you hardly notice the oak influence. Yet, it's there in the form of buttered toast. The result is a big, powerful Chardonnay, clean and vibrant, for drinking now with dramatic shellfish and pork dishes.",MacRostie 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
5195,"This early peek at Margerum's 2012 Rhône-style red wines holds the promise of future great releases from the acclaimed vintage.

5196,"Intense sensations of blue flower, juicy marasca cherry, blackberry and blueberry form the focus of this luminous blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Alicante.

But the smoked meat and black pepper notes belong to Syrah.",Raymond 2010 Small Lot Collection Syrah (Napa Valley)
5202,"Fragances of wild berries, bramble and honeysuckle pave the way for flavors of cherry cola, toffee and tangerine zest.

5403,"The main taste impression of this superripe Cabernet is of chocolate-covered raisins. Then the even riper notes of prunes emerge.

5415,"Made from a grape that probably hails from the Somontano region of Spain (where it is known as Parraleta) this is a tight, stalky wine that has acidity and black currant fruit in abundance.

5416,"Medium-gold to the eye, this wine has an interesting nose of grapefruit and coffee bean.

5428,"This sports a blue label, to differentiate it from the winery's estate bottling. It's dark and toasty, with robust black-cherry fruit, along with strong notes of charcoal, espresso and vanilla. There's nothing subtle here, but should work well with Korean ribs.",Troon 2013 Blue Label Zinfandel (Applegate Valley)
5429,"Smoky and rustic upfront, this mature Nebbiolo smells of cherry, cassis and wet cement. In the mouth, this is a bit heavy and syrupy, with grabby tannins and an overall sticky feel.

5439,"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors. Turns minty on the finish, with a hint of herbal green. Fruity and nice but lacks that final gear.",Bodega Noemía de Patagonia 2010 A Lisa Malbec (Patagonia)
5440,"Peach and lemon combine in this superripe Chablis. Reflecting the warm vintage, the wine is soft, laced with lime juice acidity and hinting at vanilla and thyme. Round and warm, it is not typical Chablis, much more akin to a Meursault.",Labouré-Roi 2009 Premier Cru Réserve  (Chablis)
5441,"This exciting Brut Prosecco shows a very floral and fruity bouquet followed by a crisp, drying mouthfeel. The high quality of the aromas is what sets this wine apart from the competition.",Le Colture NV Fagher Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
5442,"Macari's supple, vanilla-scented Cab Franc is upfront and approachable in its sour cherry fruitfulness, yet boasts some complexity with layers of ripe, brambly wood, dust and dark floral notes.

5443,"Pungently perfumed, all lemon, mandarin orange and spice, this Gewürztraminer is moderately textured and aromatically pretty, an interesting companion to spicy food but also the myriad of flavors found around a holiday meal.",McFadden 2009 Gewürztraminer (Potter Valley)
5444,"A welcome return to form for Morgan's Sauvignon Blanc, after a few disappointing vintages. This 2010 is dry and crisp in acidity, with ripe gooseberry and Meyer lemon fruit flavors. A touch of French oak adds welcome richness.",Morgan 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey)

5451,"Very ripe and spicy, with a sprinkle of dusty Christmas spices tanging up the wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. Zin doesn't get much richer, but this one could be a little firmer in structure. Drink now.",Gary Farrell 2009 Bradford Mountain Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
5452,"This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you'd expect, it's a big wine for a rosé, a little heavy, but there's a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry? Sort of, with a jammy finish of black raspberries. Try this easy-drinking wine with grilled tuna or a hamburger.",Virage 2010 Rosé (Napa Valley)

5464,"There are some lean, green peppercorn, mint and herb flavors that suggest unripeness. The chilly vintage appears to have taken its toll, despite some well-oaked raspberry and cherry lushness. Drink up.",Longoria 2011 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
5465,"Tastes rich and forward, with cherry pie, blueberry and sandalwood flavors. The color is dark, and the wine is a little too soft, as well as hot in alcohol. Drink up.",Ludwig 2010 Hammerklavier McIntyre Vineyard Pinot Noir-Dornfelder Red (Santa Lucia Highlands)
5466,"The nose on this round, medium-bodied wine is defined by sweet oak and milk chocolate. In the mouth, it's chunky and ripe, with raw tannins.

5467,"Wayward aromas of tropical fruits and diesel fumes are warm and mild.

5469,"Mango, presumably, is the dog pictured on the label. This is a heavily-extracted, somewhat bitter Merlot, with fruit flavors of blackberry syrup, alcohol at 15%, and still a fair amount of green bitterness to the tannins. Notes of iodine and anise come into play in the finish.",Passion Vineyards 2009 Mango's Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))

5472,"With its soft bouquet and friendly but easygoing melon and apple flavors, this ranks as a good but chunky SB with maturity and moderate oxidation already showing. It's good, tasty and easygoing, but it lacks the sizzle and snap Chilean SB is known for. Drink immediately.",Rios de Chile 2012 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
5473,Round Pond's track record with Sauvignon Blanc is pretty consistent. The wine is rarely great—almost never bad–but frequently satisfactory. The 2012 is one of their better efforts—a little ripe in profile—but clean and savory.,Round Pond 2012 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)

5478,"This is concentrated and dark in color, with chocolaty berry and plum aromas. A full-bodied, plump and oaky palate houses milk chocolate and herbal blackberry flavors, while a healthy, driving finish with residual oak winds things down.",Vistamar 2011 Sepia Reserva Merlot (Central Valley)
5479,"Released young, this fresh and citrusy wine is all about the fruit. Full in the mouth, it quickly settles into a cherry vanilla mid-palate, and sails on through a clean finish.",Willamette Valley Vineyards 2011 Whole Cluster Fermented Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
5480,"Fermented in one ton French oak fermenters, this estate grown Pinot Noir from 1980s plantings has notes of cherry, char, and butterscotch. The fruit is on the lighter side of medium bodied with the wood just a bit too heavy for the wine that's in the glass.",Wy'East Vineyards 2010 Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR))
5481,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is a lightly aromatic Gris with red apple and apple blossom. It's full bodied with a touch of residual sugar and a zip of acidity. A light ale note makes it seem not entirely finished.",Wy'East Vineyards 2012 Pinot Gris (Columbia Gorge (OR))

Drink now.",Caliterra 2011 Tributo Single Vineyard Block #Algarrobo Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
5485,"This ambitious winery continues to struggle to find the formula for pricy Chardonnay. They turn now to this new Sonoma County appellation, but the result is still pretty ordinary.

5486,"Solid and tannic with a stalky character both from young fruit and acidity. There is structure, black currant fruits and dense, dry tannins. The wine needs to age for at least 3–4 years.",Château Léoube 2011 Rouge de Léoube Red (Côtes de Provence)

5489,"Ecco Domani delivers consistent, easy-drinking wines that work well on informal occasions, but don't necessarily offer personality or territorial typicity.

If you are hankering for bright citrus and peach with mouth-cleansing acidity, this is a great choice.",Ecco Domani 2011 Collezione Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
5490,"This is super-rich, but wears its high alcohol lightly. That gives great full fruit, blackberry flavors, a juicy ripe wine that balances the wood and acidity to give fine potential for a year's time.",Grands Terroirs de France 2010 Grand Cru  (Saint-Émilion)
5491,"Structured and elegant, it opens with a fruit fragrance of black plum, wild berries and prune accentuated with hints of leather, tilled soil and spice.

Drink now–2022.",Tenute Silvio Nardi 2007 Poggio Doria  (Brunello di Montalcino)

5493,"The restrained aromatics of wet grass and gentle smoke are the only reminders that this is Sauvignon Blanc. This is lightyears removed from the pungently fragrant style that has made the variety so popular—here, it comes in a grown-up, classy guise with wonderfully judged balance and a lovely midpalate weight.",Neumeister 2012 Klausen Sauvignon Blanc (Südoststeiermark)
5494,"Aromatic with crushed rock, raspberry, cranberry and hints of clove, this well-structured wine—53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot—will reward additional bottle age. The young, tart red fruits are steely and precise, the barrel influence perfectly balanced against the natural acidity.",Pepper Bridge 2011 Seven Hills Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5495,"The vintage was a good one for Sequum, which is assembling an impressive track record. The wine is dry and tannic, yet wonderfully forward in blackberries and black currants, and the oak application is perfect. Give it until 2020 or so in the cellar.",Sequum 2009 Kidd Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5496,"The four soils designation refers to the wine's origins in different vineyards throughout the valley. A great followup to the marvelous 2009, the wine showcases artful blending. It's incredibly rich and ripe in black currants, cassis liqueur and smoky oak, yet balanced in acids and tannins. Drink now and through 2022.",Sequum 2010 Four Soil Melange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
5497,"Very subtle hints of green and yellow pears play on the nose, intensifying on the palate and coming across round and plump, but not without some straightening, tonic freshness. There is a satisfying depth here, something mineral, and its elegance ensures that it's firm but not overbearing. A testament to what Pinot Blanc can be in the right hands.",Tinhof 2012 Golden Erd Weissburgunder (Burgenland)
5498,"This dynamite Tempranillo hails from a top producer and a top vintage. Aromas of toasty oak, graphite, coffee and blackberry feed into a rugged but generous palate fueled by firm tannins. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate finish long, with mild heat and menthol notes that suggest aging is appropriate. Drink from 2015 through 2025.",Astrales 2010 Christina  (Ribera del Duero)
5499,"While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance. The acidity, dark berry fruits and a fine juicy character go with the firm tannins and spicy wood character. Drink from 2017.",Château Lilian Ladouys 2011  Saint-Estèphe
5500,"Even at more than four years of age, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot remains huge in primary cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. The tough, astringent tannins make it essentially undrinkable now. Yet its underling wholesomeness and balance guarantee development through 2021, and possibly longer.",Duckhorn 2009 The Discussion Red (Napa Valley)
5501,"This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California. It's ripe and forward in papaya, quince, mango, pear and pineapple fruits, but also shows a steely minerality that's as fresh and pure as snowmelt water in a pebbly stream. It is never forward or over-the-top.",Fess Parker 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
5502,"plush wine, it's made from 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot. It starts off with aromas of black berries, plum and stewed prunes along with a whiff of cedar. The warm, low-acid palate delivers mature black cherry, black currants, tobacco and black pepper alongside big, ripe tannins and the warmth of the noticeable alcohol. Drink through 2020. Lyra Wine, The Shepherd Company.",Giovanni Chiappini 2010 Guado de' Gemoli  (Bolgheri Superiore)
5503,"Hints of lemon peel rise shyly from the glass, becoming more intense with air. The palate is dry, buffered and has a savory undertow of wild thyme that interplays beautifully with sumptuous peach notes and that almost textured, zesty acidity that unites everything and brings extended, refreshing length.",Arndorfer 2012 Strasser Winberge Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
5504,"While the nose discloses little, the palate displays an array of apricot, sharp arugula and white pepper with some grapefruit zest. Focused and streamlined, this wine delivers lip-smacking freshness, great concentration and a super-clean finish. Drink as of 2016.",Jurtschitsch 2012 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
5505,"The wine is all about firm structure and dense tannins. It is concentrated while hiding rich, generous fruits. It still needs to balance the structure with the fruit. For the future, it will be a rich wine full of power.",Clos du Marquis 2011  Saint-Julien
5506,"Held back for more than four years, this Cab remains tough in tannins and lush in primary fruits. It's as ripe as any '09 out there, with black cherry, currant, chocolate and roasted coconut flavors. A succulent sweetness runs throughout, despite the absolutely dry finish. Hold until 2018, and if you have more than one bottle, drink one every additional year.",Duckhorn 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
5507,"Lime-zesty purity couples with an earthy, almost spicy edge. Pleasantly grippy phenolics speak of ripeness and plentitude while remaining streamlined, straight and long. This has yet to blossom but will be lovely. Drink as of 2017.",Eichinger 2012 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
5508,"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.",Gamache 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
5509,"Grapefruit zest dominates this wine right now, but ripe honeydew melon also is shining though. As the wine opens up, it also reveals peppery, tangy spice and a refreshingly clean finish.",Gruber Röschitz 2012 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
5510,"Dried fruit flavors and the bitter tang of dark fir honey are spiked by concentrated lemony acidity. The nose and palate are round and rich, but tamed by acidity that runs through like an electric current. This rich, dry but distinctly late-harvest style wine, with just a touch of residual sugar, finishes with triumphant apple fruit and lemon zest.",Hager Matthias 2012 Seeberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
5511,"Bright cherry and blue floral aromas come with hints of leather and spice. The vibrant palate delivers succulent wild cherry and white pepper restrained by fresh acidity and bracing tannins. It has mesmerizing depth, finesse and balance. Drink 2015–2028.",Salvioni 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
5512,"Rich, loamy and ripe smelling, this wine opens in fine form, with accents of raisin, cassis and ink. The mouthfeel is deep and balanced, while flavors of toasty blackberry, cassis and chocolate are ripe and modern. Finishing notes of coffee, licorice, blackened toast and pepper bring a dark side to this long-lasting, deeply etched Malbec. Drink through 2018.",SignoSeis 2011 The Angel Oak Reserva Malbec (Valle de Uco)
5513,"Creamy notes of red and yellow apples, just an edge of citrus zestiness and inviting notions of apricot announce a subtle, elegant white with a dense but never heavy structure. Rounded fruit with a wonderfully linear trajectory make this a worthwhile food companion. This is a wonderful expression of the indigenous Austrian Zierfandler.",Stadlmann 2012 Mandel-Höh Zierfandler (Thermenregion)
5514,"The delicate smoke and hazelnut scent of oak shines through and makes a frame for ripe apricot and Mirabelle plums. The palate is soft and rounded, set off by pizzazz from the lively acidity that underlines the juicy core.",Ingrid Groiss 2012 Sauberg Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
5515,"Sweaty, briny aromas are borderline offputting. This is plump on the palate, with flavors of pickled citrus fruits. The same can be said for the finish, which is also bitter, resiny and overoaked.",Casas del Bosque 2013 Gran Reserva Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
5516,"Modest citrus, earth and almond notes come up from the glass, and continue in the flavors of this smooth, rounded, and straightforward wine. The balance is on the soft side, and the body is quite light.",Peltier 2013 Hybrid Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi)
5517,A soft and indistinct wine that is fat and has only the merest hint of fruit. It is round with some fresh acidity at the end.,Quinta do Cavalinho 2014 Vale das Donas White (Tejo)
5518,"Rubbery, herbal aromas of stalky black fruits are typical of the variety but also gritty and horsey smelling. This has a snappy, grating mouthfeel and flavors of herbal blackberry and plum along with an acid-driven palate. Licorice, oak and vanilla flavors are present on the finish.",Santa Alicia 2014 Reserva Espiritu de Los Andes Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
5519,"Aromas of green bean, shoe polish, carob and blackberry are heavy and oaky. A creamy weight dominates the palate, which also shows an unbalanced streak of tartaric acid. Herbal blackberry, plum and licorice flavors finish minty, with a resinous oak feel.",Santa Luz 2014 Reserva Encinos Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
5520,"This is a bright pink-colored wine, with caramel as much as fruit flavors. It has a light touch of acidity that gives the wine a lift at the end.",Quinta do Cavalinho 2014 Herdade dos Templários Rosé (Tejo)
5521,"Rusty and light in color, with a dilute, stalky set of aromas, this thin Pinot is dry, a touch bitter and largely fruitless on the flavor profile. A bland, lightly woody finish tastes stalky and not fully ripe.",Tres Palacios 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Maipo Valley)

5523,"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.",Don Bernardino 2013 Godello (Valdeorras)
5524,"Here's a frail red that offers weak sensations of sour cherry and strawberry alongside zesty acidity and fleeting, gritty tannins. It's short and dilute.",Grati 2014 Red (Toscana)
5525,"Leafy, earthy cherry and plum aromas lead to a clampy, astringent palate with saucy, tart, rubbery plum flavors. Savory spice notes come up on a tannic, drying, unyielding finish.",Pata Negra 2012 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)
5526,"This Riesling smells slightly tropical but more like grass and asparagus. A linear body is propped up by lemony acidity, while flavors of lemon peel, tangerine and lees finish citric. Overall, this smells and tastes nothing like the Riesling most people know.",Cristiari 2013 Riesling (Costers del Segre)
5527,"Earthy, vegetal aromas and equally earthy, peppery flavors make this wine unusually rustic. It does have traces of good aged character, like leather and tea.",Ripken 2011 Under the Sea Primitivo (Lodi)
5528,"Sturdy and basic, this Pinot Noir has vegetal aromas, modest fruit flavors, and a dry, lean texture. Aromas suggest tomato and herbs, while flavors are more rich.",Camelot NV Pinot Noir (California)
5529,"Cheesy, oaky aromas are staunch and less than appealing. A choppy, astringent palate and mulchy, briny berry flavors are less than helpful, while a rubbery feeling finish also fails to bring this around.",Dominio del Viento 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)
5530,"This rosé is made from Cabernet Franc grapes, and it's briny to an extreme, with vegetal aromas. The palate is scattered in feel and lacks grace, while pickled citrus dominates the flavor profile. A mustardy, briny finish with jalapeño notes is no savior.",Lomas del Valle 2014 Coastal Cool Climate Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc Rosé (Casablanca Valley)
5531,"Seltzer and sauerkraut are off putting on the nose. It's scattered and salty tasting, with citrus and celery notes.",François Lurton 2013 Hermanos Lurton Verdejo (Rueda)
5532,"Mild citrus and grassy aromas are quiet, while this feels pithy and flat for a young wine. Tangerine and persimmon flavors are not on the money for Sauvignon Blanc, with a mildly bitter and pyrazinic finish.",Alto Los Romeros 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
5533,"Blue-fruit aromas and flavors are indistinct on the nose. Massive tannins, lemony oak, plastic and graphite notes drive the palate. The finish is a forced marriage of licorice, oak, and vanilla.",Montes 2013 Classic Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
5534,"Aromas of rubber and floor wax lack fruit and nuance. This has a high-acid, granular mouthfeel that lacks full cohesion. Waxy, salty flavors crowd out primary fruit flavors, while this finishes briny, high in acid and salty.",Zerran 2013 Garnatxa Blanca Garnacha Blanca (Montsant)
5535,"Aromas of peach pit, dried almond skins and white pineapple are on the raw side, while the palate on this Viognier-heavy blend is waxy yet citric. Flavors of white grapefruit and lemon are pithy, and finish with bitter almond flavors.",Estampa 2013 Estate Viognier-Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
5536,"This is an unusual mix of disparate flavors—some spice, some mint, eucalyptus, lemon, pineapple—all with a rather bitter edge. It falls apart on the finish, with a chemical, paint thinner aftertaste.",Gresser NV Brut Sparkling (Willamette Valley)
5537,"This medium-bodied wine has very subtle aromas and flavors, a fairly smooth texture, and an ever-so-slightly buttery accent. It offers a slim personality to enjoy.",Insomnia 2013 Pinot Grigio (California)
5538,"The aromas are driven by freshly cut wood tones, while the palate is full, creamy and oaky. Raw wood and resin flavors are like licking a plank, and the only flavors in this wine besides oak are lanolin and cinnamon.",Santa Alba 2012 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
5539,"This is a very watery, almost scentless wine, with hints of golden apples on the nose. The palate is also lacking, showing slight pears and nectarines. The DIY label is a cute gimmick though.",Scratchpad 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast)
5540,"Cherry and red-plum aromas are also horsey, jammy and suggestive of bacon fat. An astringent palate ranks as severely rugged and drawing. Bitter red-plum flavors simmer prior to a hard-tannin finish that's peppery and tart.",Terrai 2013 OVG Garnacha (Cariñena)
5541,"Wheaty and waxy on the nose, this Viura also smells of vinyl and corn. A limited palate is directed by pointed acidity, while flavors of almond skins and pithy citrus are somewhat bitter and finish with zero character.",Bodegas Riojanas 2013 Puerta Vieja Blanco Viura (Rioja)
5542,"Barnyard aromas with coffee grinds and lemony blackberry are less than inviting. This feels raw, scratchy and abrasive; flavors of herbal cherry and plum turn green and weedy on the finish.",Santa Ema 2014 Select Terroir Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley)
5543,"Chunky aromas of hay and mealy stone fruits are acceptable. This Sauvignon Blanc has a melony, creamy palate and mealy flavors of melon and papaya that match the bouquet. A yeasty, undefined finish indicates this is past its prime.",Trencalòs 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
5544,"Dark and ominous in color, with a grapy, rustic, smoky nose, this Garnacha is high in acid, rubbery and tannic on the palate. Semisour black-plum flavors finish equally tannic and acidic.",Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2013 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena)
5545,"Loosen's best Dr. L to date, this is a terrific value, delivering typical Mosel Riesling notes at a great price. Citrus blossom, lime and crushed stone aromas are followed by apple and citrus flavors in this just-slightly-sweet wine. Drink it now and over the next year or so.",Loosen Bros. 2010 Dr. L Riesling (Mosel)
5546,"Mer Soleil's Chardonnay grapes dependably get so ripe, they offer explosive flavors even without oak. You won't miss a thing without that barrel. The pineapple, orange and golden mango flavors are delicious on their own, and even offer a hint of vanilla. A mouthwateringly fresh squeeze of acidity makes everything bright and clean.",Mer Soleil 2010 Silver Unoaked Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
5547,"Like the label says, this Viognier is sweet, with honey, apricot, orange and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with fine acidity. Give it more concentration, and the score would soar. Still, it's a very nice dessert wine for the price.",Novy 2010 Oley Late Harvest Sweet Viognier (Russian River Valley)
5548,"Virtually identical with Pinot Noir, and quite a good one at that. Shows cool-climate influence in the translucent color, vital acidity and pure flavors of raspberries and persimmons, accented with smoky oak.",Novy 2010 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Sonoma Mountain)
5549,"A super-interesting blend of 37% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 18% Carignan, 10% Petite Sirah, 10% Grenache and 8% Tannat, the bouquet is loaded with assertive aromas of black currant, licorice, black olive, whole tobacco leaf, cigar box spice and leather. Creamy but firmly textured, like crushed velvet, with a rich boysenberry and plum juiciness to the palate.",Spice Route 2009 Chakalaka Red (Swartland)
5550,"This excellent and beautifully crisp Sauvignon from Alto Adige would make a perfect companion to regional dishes including dumplings, omelets and frittatas flavored with fragrant mountain herbs. The screwcap bottle locks in fresh floral aromas, natural rubber and citrus.",Tiefenbrunner 2009 Kirchleiten Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
5551,"Big-hearted wine, full of warm and rich fruit. It has a solid core of dusty tannins, black plum fruit flavors and a delicious, chewy, juicy texture. It does have power as well as intense fruitiness. Age for 3–4 years.",Château Eugénie 2008 Cuvée Pierre le Grand Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)
5552,"Honey flavored wine, packed with botrytis and also with intense acidity. That makes the wine light, dancing, while also showing richness. It is all so light, delicate, so delicious.",Château Jolys 2009 Cuvée Jean  (Jurançon)
5553,"Almost black, this is a concentrated, black plum skin- and blackberry-driven wine, laced throughout with dense tannins. It has weight and concentration as well as the ripest juicy fruit. Age for 3–4 years.",Château Ponzac 2008 Patiement Malbec (Cahors)
5554,"Campanaro is a unique blend of Fiano and Greco grapes that opens with a beautiful bouquet of stone fruit, honey, white almond and Golden Delicious apple. It a dry, crisp wine with a focused, fine feel in the mouth.",Feudi di San Gregorio 2009 Campanaro White (Irpinia)

5556,"Big, spicy wine with its dark tannins and black fruit. Dark chocolate flavors go with the fruit, a rich and complex array of flavors that bring in herbs and spices as well as wood. Age for another 1–2 years.",Henri Milan 2006 Les Clos Red (Les Baux de Provence)
5557,"Yes, this does not shy away from the herbal bite often found in Oregon Pinot. But that accent is nicely integrated into a firm, balanced wine with penetrating red fruits and darker notes of black coffee, black licorice and a whiff of fresh truffle.",Illahe 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
5558,"A Bordeaux-style blend made from 50% Cab Sauv, 30% Merlot and 20% Cab Franc and aged in new French oak for 24 months, this ripe and lush wine is ready for drinking now with easygoing black cherry and blackberry fruit aromas and flavors laced with notes of pepper, licorice root, tobacco leaf and soft leather. The creamy mouthfeel is given structure with medium tannins and balanced acidity.",Jardin 2006 Cobblers Hill Red (Stellenbosch)
5559,"As pure an expression of a Malbec dominated blend as possible, this is ripe, juicy, packed with fine acidity and underpinned by solid, dry tannins. It balances the firm, dry character with delicious, forward, juicy fruit.",Jean-Luc Baldès 2008 Clos Triguedina Red (Cahors)
5560,"The most impressive of the range of wines from Laurenz Moser V. It is tight with minerality, pepper and apple skin flavors. With a steely texture and intense youthful acidity, it's a wine that needs to age for at least 2 years. Screwcap.",Laurenz V. 2010 Charming Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
5561,"If you love Italian whites, Confini is definitely worth your attention. It represents a blend of Pinot Grigio, Traminer and Riesling. The obvious outcome is that the first variety supplies the density and creaminess, and the last two drive the fragrant floral bouquet.",Lis Neris 2008 Confini White (Venezia Giulia)
5562,Soft layers of Chardonnay with aromas of vanilla cream and stone fruit are blended with fresh notes of citrus and passion fruit from the Vermentino element found within. The two varieties complement each other very well and produce an elegant wine for shellfish or seafood risotto.,Lungarotti 2008 Torveto White (Umbria)
5563,"Blackberry and rubber aromas are friendly and forward, with spice added in for good measure. Feels full, lush and cushioned, with integrated tannins, good acidity and bright red berry flavors dusted by herbs and spice. Finishes smooth and true. A winning wine from a difficult vintage.",Martino 2008 Reserva Old Vine Malbec (Agrelo)
5564,"That this small-lot Lodi producer has ventured out to the Russian River Valley for Zinfandel says something here and it says it with finesse, this being austere for Zin, not jammy, with enviable structure and a nice lift of black cherry, spicy cola and earth at the end.",McCay Cellars 2008 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
5565,Penon Pinot Bianco is a fragrant and intense white wine with aromas of stone fruit and white rose splashed over a dense and creamy mouthfeel. This beautiful white wine would match northern Italian dishes such as paper-thin lasagna with a poppy seed cream filler.,Nals Margreid 2009 Penon Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
5566,"Novy's Syrahs have really hit their stride lately. This one, from this little Sonoma County appellation, is soft and rich in blackberries, blueberries and Canadian bacon, with a smoky layer of charred oak. It is, in a word, delicious.",Novy 2008 Judge Family Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley)
5567,"Textbook entry-level Riesling, tightly coiled and medium-bodied, with lovely tension between sweet green-apple fruit notes, minerally hints of crushed stone and zesty acids that recall pink grapefruit. Drink now.",Peter Nicolay 2010 Riesling (Mosel)
5568,"Tuscan dishes celebrate fresh, seasonal ingredients such as fava beans, artichokes, asparagus, zucchini and extra virgin olive oil. This structured white wine offers the richness of texture and aromatic intensity to pair with the best of that culinary tradition.",Agricola Querciabella 2008 Batàr White (Toscana)
5569,"An interesting, well-made blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat that deals lemony oak, spice, coconut and ripe berry aromas.

A complete package; drink now through 2014.",Benvenuto de la Serna 2007 Trisagio Red (Uco Valley)
5570,Pinot Bianco is a fantastic food wine that delivers good density and natural creaminess without being too fragrant or perfumed. This beautiful expression delivers the best that this grape variety awards in an exceedingly crisp and clean package.,Cantina Cortaccia 2010 Hofstatt Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
5571,"Soft and unctuous, this wine has sweet flavors of ripe fruits, glycerine and new oak, balanced with crisp acidity. Pinotage is the South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, and the wine has a silky texture and luscious flavors of cherries, red currants, vanilla and pepper spice. Terrific with mushroom risotto.",Longboard 2007 Wholer Vineyard Pinotage (Russian River Valley)
5572,"Still very young with its tannins dominant, this will nevertheless be a richly fruity wine as it develops. The black fruits are all there, along with licorice and bitter chocolate. Final acidity brings a lift to the dense texture.",Jean-Luc Baldès 2009 Château de Flore Malbec (Cahors)
5573,"The name of this wine doesn't lie; if you like mint, then this one's definitely for you! Gorgeous notes of fresh eucalyptus take center stage to the blackberry and boysenberry fruit backbone. The menthol continues on in the mouth, with a gripping and structured finish that tastes like Thin Mint crumbles.",Morgenhof 2009 Mint Haven Cabernet Sauvignon (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)
5574,"This is a gorgeous Italian white (made with Pinot Bianco grapes) that shows promising food pairing potential thanks to its silky, creamy mouthfeel and non-intrusive aromas.

5576,"Dynamic aromas of honeysuckle and mint gumdrop precede intense honey, orange, tangerine and marmalade flavors. This is a thicker, more oily style of Torrontes than the commonly seen watery ones, and it makes a statement via its viscosity and power.",Michel Torino 2007 Cuma Organic Torrontés (Cafayate)
5577,"Italy's first cru Verdicchio, Le Moie offers loads of citrus-and lime-like nuances on the heels of stone fruit, field flowers and fruit candy. Sweet fruit notes create a lively, tangy impression. A tiny percentage is aged in wood.",Fazi Battaglia 2005 Le Moie  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
5578,"Soft and lush, the flavors are just delicious, ranging from cherries and cassis to cola, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, rose petal tea and Asian spices. With every sip, you find something new. The wine would benefit from a firmer texture, though, as it's on the soft, one-dimensional side.",Miner 2005 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
5579,"One of the most attractive aspects of this fresh white blend is its structure: The wine is silky and smooth and seemingly weightless at the same time. That kind of structure is a good platform for flavors of pear, exotic fruit, honey and almond. Try it with grilled shrimp in a cilantro pesto sauce.",Monte del Frá 2005 Cà del Magro  (Custoza Superiore)
5580,"Intense flavors of mango, melon and apricot lead on this lively but rich dessert. The palate is bursting with flavor but layered spice softens and adds depth. The sweetness is enhanced by a pretty floral character that lingers through the finish. Imported by Wine Emporium.",Pillitteri 2004 Select Late Harvest Riesling (Niagara Peninsula)
5581,"It's pure Rosenblum, as sweet as a confection, as delicious as a filling made from blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, cinnamon, vanilla and white sugar. It's impossible not to be impressed and troubled by a wine such as this.",Rosenblum 2005 Rominger Vineyard Syrah (Yolo County)
5582,"With its aromas of citrus and honey and its exuberant flavors of tropical fruit and toasted spice, this is both pretty and playful. Sweet but full of finesse, the wine has floral element that adds to its allure.",Wagner 2006 Ice Vidal Blanc (Finger Lakes)
5583,"Butter and dill are the first aromas to make themselves noticed, and below that there's raw oak and lighter-weight fruit notes. The palate shows ample resin and wood notes along with pepper and spice. It's a good wine with serious intent, but it seems a little overwooded and a tiny bit green. Cabernet Sauvignon leads the blend, with Merlot and Cab Franc filling it out.",Luigi Bosca 2004 Gala 2 Red (Mendoza)
5584,"Pineapple, banana, peach and apricot are followed by a dusty mineral quality that adds extra dimension. This is a tasty, fruit-forward wine that closes with tingling, spicy crispness.",Masottina 2005 Ai Palazzi Pinot Grigio (Piave)
5585,"This refreshing wine is clean and dry, with grapefruit, peach and honeysuckle flavors boosted by high, tingly acidity. Made Sancerre-style, it leaves behind a spicy, fruity aftertaste.",Andretti 2006 Selections Fumé Blanc (North Coast)
5586,"A little big and heavy, but that's the style that Kaiken has pushed since arriving on the market a few years ago. This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver. The 14.5% alcohol level tells you that it's a big boy.",Kaiken 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
5587,"There is just 9% Cabernet in the blend. Smooth and light, with lean flavors showing herb and bark. The tannins have a green edge to them, and perhaps as a result, the vanilla flavors  seem to stick out rather awkwardly.",Kestrel 2004 Merlot (Yakima Valley)
5588,"This winery seems to be trying to find an identity. The Cabs are vintage-driven, and do better in cool years, which 2004 wasn't. This wine is a little soft and direct, but delicious enough, with ripe, pastry-filling blackberry, cherry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors. You can taste high-char oak on the finish.",Martin Ranch 2004 Thérèse Vineyards Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
5589,"Here's a no fuss wine for everyday dinners with loads of fresh fruit, kiwi, pineapple and a strong emphasis on floral fragrances. The flavors focus on dried fruit, sun-dried apple chips in particular.",Aldegheri 2006 le Pietre White (Veronese)
5590,"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm.",Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Sangiovese (Red Mountain)
5591,"Definitely more neutral than other Pinot Biancos from the same vintage, this wine delivers measured aromas of apple, pear, peach and natural rubber that is consistent with the variety's traditional characteristics. It's an approachable, everyday wine.",Cantina Terlano 2006 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
5592,"You'll love the delicate floral fragrances of this feminine, cool-climate northern Italian white. Acacia, jasmine and honeysuckle play a leading role with a supporting cast of stone fruit and pear. In the mouth, it's not particularly intense or thick.",Girlan 2006 Toretta Classico White (Alto Adige)
5593,"Hints of honey and orange marmalade on the nose suggest a wine moving toward maturity at a rapid pace, and one gets a similar impression from the palate, which shows similar development. It's stony and layered with honeyed citrus without being sweet, with a wiry feel to the lingering finish. Drink now.",Carl Ehrhard 2008 Rudesheimer Kabinett Dry Riesling (Rheingau)
5594,"From this longstanding grape grower and Napa-based producer is a Mendocino-sourced Gewürztraminer that's beautifully gold in color and full of pretty tropical aromas. Balanced, with good acidity, this is a Gewürztraminer that's light on its feet and still retains the right amount of spice.",Madrigal 2010 Gewürztraminer (Mendocino)
5595,"Crisp green aromas suggest lime and then passion fruit. It's lively and spritzy in the mouth, with high acidity yielding green flavors that transition to pithy and heavy. Lemon-lime mixed with celery notes come up on the finish.",Matetic 2010 EQ Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)
5596,"Smoky, dark and rich, this oak-aged Ripasso is packed tight with savory aromas of barbecue smoke, bresaola, licorice and sun-dried fruit. There's a sweet note on the close followed by smooth, soft tannins.",Montezovo 2009  Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso
5597,"Toasty, minty and sweet smelling. The palate is dark, full and choppy feeling, with cola, coconut, mint, blackberry and cassis flavors. There's good power and depth to this Malbec; a bit rough and herbal at the finish line.",Odfjell 2009 Orzada Malbec (Lontué Valley)
5598,"Aromas of cedar and damp soil lend a clean, foresty air to this beautifully ripe yet restrained Bordeaux blend. Black fruit flavors are intensely concentrated yet brisk with acidity, strident grape tannins and a lingering granite finish.",Pellegrini Vineyards 2005 Reserve Red (North Fork of Long Island)
5599,"This medium-bodied Riesling shows some already-evolving notes of honey, truffle and petrol wrapped around its core of apple and citrus. Seems a little on the sweeter side of the trocken spectrum.",Prinz Salm 2009 Wallhausen Johannisberg GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
5600,"Among the single-vineyard 2008 Pinots from Rex Hill, this is the lightest in flavor and style. Ripe strawberry fruit, medium-bodied, is buttressed with generous natural acidity. Highlights of fresh-cut herbs dot the finish.",Rex Hill 2008 Alloro Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
5601,"Exotic pineapple, lime and tangerine scents combine with notes of slate and wet stone on this lovely Riesling. It's quite dry, but feels lush on the palate with a sweet grapefruit softness. Finishes long and minerally.",Rooster Hill 2009 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
5602,"Minerality and passion fruit aromas control the bouquet. The palate is fresh and zesty, with grapefruit, lime and green apple flavors. Holds its form and tightness on the finish, staying juicy and fresh from front to back.",Root:1 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
5603,"For $9 a nice wine in a nice package, made from old-vine Zinfandel from Lodi. The red fruit on the nose pops out pleasantly followed by smooth tannins and a fruity, chocolaty mix of flavors.","Salvatore Principe 2009 Take Flight, Artists Collection Limited Edition Zinfandel (Lodi)"
5604,This well crafted wine opens with textured renderings of barbecue spice and toasted oak followed by velvety fruit and blackberry. The wine is layered and deep with a playful touch of sour fruit on the close.,Sartori 2006 I Saltari Le Vigne di Turano  (Valpolicella Superiore)
5605,"Swirls of smoke and freshly pressed apples entice on the nose of this lean, dry Riesling. On the palate, hints of chalk and wet stone meld with a shower of fresh white grapefruit flavors, finishing long with a bold smoke and honey note.",Sheldrake Point 2007 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes)
5606,"Beatifully pétillant with small, persistent beads, this hints of tangerine and lemons skins against a backdrop of fresh mushrooms and madacamia nuts. The foam is quite mouthfilling, but lemony acidity leads to a lingering finish.",Sparkling Pointe 2005 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island)
5607,"One of the richer, riper Edna Valley Pinots, offering waves of raspberry and cherry marmalade flavors. It sure is delicious, if a little direct. Drink now with lusty fare, like cold smoked salmon or chorizo.",Stephen Ross 2009 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
5608,"Amarone La Coeta opens with huge oak tones of spice and campfire that will definitely need a few more years of cellar aging before they soften. But this wood-heavy formula does work, given the hearty, thick nature of the wine itself.",Corte Lenguin 2007 La Coeta  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
5609,"This Ripasso-method Valpolicella is aged for two years in cherry wood to add complexity and intensity to its aromatic bouquet. You'll recognize tones of cola, dark spice, mature fruit, cassis and bitter almond.",Corte Sant' Alda 2008 Campi Magri  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso)

5611,"Pleasantly yeasty on the nose with hints of sweet biscuit and brioche, Wiemer's Cuvée Brut is dry and fresh with a bright, lemony midpalate. Persistently effervescent with clean, nervy acidity.",Hermann J. Wiemer 2006 Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Finger Lakes)
5612,"There's a gorgeous sheen of minerality that glimmers from start to finish on this vervy but honey-kissed off-dry Riesling. Smoky and rich on the palate with hints of slate and crushed rock, the finish is long with a tasty lime skin finish.",Hermann J. Wiemer 2009 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
5613,"Dry and bright in acidity, with a clean, silky mouthfeel. Shows fine raspberry and cherry fruit, with a squeeze of tangerine, leading to a spicy finish. Drink now with pork tenderloin, ahi tuna, roasted salmon.",Holman Ranch 2009 Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley)
5614,"Green and spunky on the nose, with light citrus aromas and nothing forced, sour or funky. The palate is full and a little creamy, with just enough acidic kick. Tastes of green melon, lime and banana. Lasting acidity provides pulse to the finish.",Viña Casablanca 2010 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
5615,"From one of Germany's few biodynamic producers, this combines struck flint and honeyed ripeness on the nose, then offers apple, citrus and fennel-like flavors. Despite the medium body, the acids are bracing and almost sharp on the finish.",Wittmann 2009 Westhofener Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen)
5616,"A long oak regime (36 months in barrel) helps cement this Amarone's tones of barbecue sauce, cola, savory spice and dark fruit. The wine shows a ripe, chewy quality with loads of masculine power and intensity.",Zanoni 2006 Zovo  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
5617,"This Ripasso presents an interesting nose with clove, fresh curry leaf, cherry liqueur and bitter chocolate. It's smooth and balanced with a simple but genuine delivery overall.",Arduini 2009  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
5618,"Well priced for the quality, Chapel Hill's Shiraz-Grenache is barely a blend, with only 10% Grenache. It comes across as a nicely complex, easy-drinking Shiraz, marrying mulberry fruit with hints of chocolate, cracked pepper and fresh herbs. The texture is plush and the finish long; a super value at under $20 to drink now and over the next few years.",Chapel Hill 2006 Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale)
5619,"New wood overwhelms the aromas, and it also dominates the palate of this wine. It just keeps on the right side of drinkability because the spice merges into pear flavors to give an intriguing nutmeg character, while the aftertaste offers freshness. The wine needs at least a year to blend together.",Château de Fuissé 2006 Les Brulés  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
5620,"Smooth and sweet, like a cream Sherry is supposed to be. On the nose, this one easily shifts from ripe apricot and peach fruit to nuts and saline. The palate starts with a blast of coffee and mocha and then folds in brown sugar and spice. Sweet, long and generous, with accents of cinnamon, clove and mild chocolate. Uncomplicated, which for $13 is a virtue.",Hidalgo NV Morenita Cream Sherry (Jerez)
5621,"With its briary flavors of fresh-picked mountain berries and exotic clove, nutmeg and pepper spices, this Zin defines a more elegant Foothills approach to the variety. The texture is light and silky, not at all heavy, a supple, polished wine of great appeal.",Karly 2006 Buck's Ten Point Zinfandel (Amador County)
5622,"Even in cooler 2007, Zull scores with this wine. It has all the right pear and apple perfumes, along with vibrant acidity and minerality. It's going to develop well over the next 4 years into a fine, elegant wine. Screwcap.",Zull 2007 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich)
5623,"Henschke is best known for its red wines, but the 2005 Louis Sémillon shows they know a thing or two about whites as well. It combines some toasty, smoky characters with herbal notes on the nose, then develops flavors of wax, spice and citrus, lingering elegantly on the finish. Tasty now, but might develop even more interesting complexities with additional age.",Henschke 2005 Louis Semillon (Eden Valley)
5624,"With its tight minerality and vivid green fruits, this is a fine representative of the freshness and richness of 2006. While Bouchard Père is generous with the wood, it does not dominate because the fruit flavor texture and finishing freshness are so important.",Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Chassagne-Montrachet
5625,"Full and rich with thick concentration, this modern Aglianico offers generous tones of blackberry, blueberry, exotic spice, chocolate, mineral, vanilla, toast, clove and cardamom. It has a luscious and clean feel in the mouth backed by sweet cherry flavors and good length.",Cantina Giardino 2004 Nude Aglianico (Irpinia)
5626,"Though Grüner doesn't have a reputation in Austria for ice wine as do other varieties, based on the strength of this wine, maybe it should. It has a great balance between toffee sweetness and high acidity, the intensity softened and broadened by spice and toffee.",Schloss Gobelsburg 2006 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
5627,"A classy Sherry with full, attractive hazelnut and peanut oil aromas. The palate holds to that nuttiness while introducing maple and toffee flavors. Thick in the mouth but not the least bit sticky, so it has that proper oloroso feel in front of a nutty, long finish.",Hidalgo NV Gobernador Oloroso Seco Palomino (Jerez)
5628,"This supple and smooth Fiano delivers notes of pear, Golden Delicious apple and yellow melon. The wine is layered and complex thanks to the mineral nuances that accompany it to the end. It is also chewy, naturally robust and promises an excellent match to lobster, crab or baked clams.",Mastroberardino 2007 Radici  (Fiano di Avellino)
5629,"The vineyard is south of the city of Napa, in a cool area, and the Merlot is traditionally ripe, dry and hard in tannins. The 2005 follows that formula. The new oak has not yet been integrated, and the wine is fresh, young and a little brash right now. But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.",Nickel & Nickel 2005 Suscol Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
5630,"This is the best Obsidian Cab since the 2002, and for similar reasons. It was a good vintage for Cabernet. The wine is rich and peppery and lush in black currant flavors, with beautifully sculpted, ripe tannins. Provides more evidence that this Red Hills of Lake County appellation has enormous potential for Cabernet.",Obsidian Ridge 2005 Obsidian Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)
5631,"A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes as fresh and vibrant as a young wine can, with exuberant flavors of pineapples, green apples, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon that are wrapped into a rich, creamy texture. Crisp acidity makes the wine brilliantly clean. With the exception of the '04, an off-vintage, this bottling has been wonderfully consistent.",Gary Farrell 2007 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
5632,"Beautifully concentrated and redolent of spice and evident oak aging, this is a powerful wine from the Amalfi Cost that offers tobacco, leather, ash, slate roof, cola, vanilla, blackberry and plump cherry. The grapes used in the blend are the little-known Tintore and Piedirosso varieties native to Campania. Who knew they could taste this good?",Giuseppe Apicella 2003 A' Scippata Riserva Costa d'Amalfi Red (Campania)
5633,"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but it's fun and delicious and utterly unique, in its own high mountain way. Completely dry, the flavors are of blackberries cooked into a pie and black pepper, with just a hint of raisins.",Karly 2005 Sadie Upton Zinfandel (Amador County)
5634,"Magno Megonio offers beautiful mineral notes behind a curtain of pulsing berry fruit and cola. This wine, made from the promising Magliocco grape, really does have character and exhibits fine winemaking in Calabria, a harsh and often overlooked region of southern Italy. Those drying minerals give the wine balance and persistency on the finish.",Librandi 2005 Magno Megonio Magliocco (Val di Neto)
5635,"Typical of a fine young S&B; Pinot, this is rather hard and closed in tannins now, although decanting will help coax out the cherry and currant fruit. But it really needs a good 4–6 years.",Longoria 2006 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
5636,"A wide-open, friendly wine, all delicious rich white fruits and tropical flavors. While it may not be ageworthy, it is a pleasure now, an opulent mouthful of Chardonnay.",Louis Latour 2006 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
5637,"The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir. Basically it offers quite similar flavors; for the extra money you get more butterfat, more cherry fruit and a little less herb. What it gains in power, the wine loses in detail and nuance; depending upon your own palate preferences, the regular estate might be the better value.",Apolloni 2006 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
5638,"Here's a bone-dry, powerful young Syrah that's packed with hard tannins. The vineyard sourcing is interesting, ranging from the Sierra Foothills through Paso Robles and the Salinas Valley to the Santa Cruz Mountains. Combining the ripe fruit of warm climates with the acidity of cool regions, the wine has black currant, beef jerky, sour cherry candy, black pepper, anise and cola flavors that are quite complex. Not likely to age, but a lovely, full-bodied red to have now.",Bonny Doon 2005 Le Pousseur Syrah (Central Coast)
5639,"Run, don't walk, to buy this wonderful Merlot by the case. An unbelievable buy from Goldschmidt Vineyards, which is doing some of the most interesting things in Sonoma Bordeaux wines, it's a soft, ripe, complex wine that shows the balance and structure of a far more expensive bottling. Brims with briary cherry, blackberry, chocolate, cedar and spice flavors that were born for charbroiled steak.",Chelsea Goldschmidt 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley)
5640,"Ripe, sweet and stylish, with blackberry, root beer and herb aromas. Bulky yet balanced, with black cherry fruit that comes at you in jammy style. Black tea, ground spices, coffee and raw oak work the finish. A dark and handsome wine, but one that isn't overly complex and is ready to drink now through 2011.",CVNE 2001 Real De Asúa  (Rioja)
5641,"Campania's celebrated Feudi di San Gregorio recently unveiled a new, revamped style for its white wines. This debut vintage delivers gorgeous tones of peachy cream and sophisticated mineral tones. It's an oak-fermented expression of Greco di Tufo from 15-year-old vines.",Feudi di San Gregorio 2006 Cutizzi  (Greco di Tufo)
5642,"Here's an elegant Pinot Noir that restaurateurs should buy for its food companionability. The mouthfeel has a lighter style than some Pinots. But it's packed with flavor, and is bone dry and crisp, making it ideal for steaks and chops or even Asian fusion. The flavors suggest cherries, black raspberries, root beer, tangerine zest, cloves, pepper and cinnamon.",Foppiano 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
5643,"Blackberry syrup, slate roof, natural rubber, exotic spice, resin and root beer describe this thickly extracted Taurasi Riserva. The wine offers power, concentration and blockbuster tannins. It would pair well with marinated beef and barbecue sauces. Drink after 2010.",GMG Vinicola 2001 Riserva  (Taurasi)
5644,"V.T.S. stands for Vintage Top Select, the prestige cuvee from Hans Moser. It's an eclectic blend of every grape imaginable, from Cabernet Sauvignon to Syrah, by way of Zweigelt and Blaufränkisch. What you get is a superrich wine that's beginning to mature, with dark plum jelly and sweet black fruit flavors. It is ripe and concentrated, just finishing with some firmness.",Hans Moser 2004 V.T.S. Red (Burgenland)
5645,"Fresh, ripe, inviting and 180° opposite of this producer's white cavas, which seem bubbly and fizzy compared to this balanced, subtle, even smoky offering. In the mouth, it's tasty and dry, with cherry nuances going stride for stride with pink grapefruit and raspberry. A refined rosé Cava that's sure to light your fire.",Oriol Rossell NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
5646,"Retour relies on fruit sourced from so-called “old vine” Pinot vineyards. It's full, fleshy, round and brightly fruity, with plenty of spicy chocolate from extended barrel aging. Some whole cluster fermentation and native yeasts contribute to the complexity. A very fine debut.",Retour 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
5647,"Meursault can manage big and bold, and this wine definitely lives up to that reputation. The spice and wood are perhaps too much at this stage. I would certainly like to see more of the ripe white fruits that are there in the background. A wine to return to in a year.",Roux Père et Fils 2006 Clos des Poruzots Premier Cru  (Meursault)
5648,"The nose does not want to give a lot away. The palate, however, shows spicy hints of nettle and a fresh bouncy zesty backbone of lemon and grapefruit, which makes it all the more appetizing.",Steininger 2015 Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
5649,"Spicy and supple, this has aromas of cured meat, white pepper, toast and dark plum that follow the warm robust palate along with dried black cherry, coffee and licorice. Round tannins provide the supple framework. Drink through 2020.",Tua Rita 2013 Per Sempre Syrah (Toscana)
5650,"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, violet and a whiff of baking spice. On the bright silky palate, notes of pipe tobacco, chopped herb and a hint of game add depth to the red-berry core.",Tua Rita 2013 Perlato del Bosco Sangiovese (Toscana)
5651,"The inviting notion of gently sun-ripened yellow plums on the nose draws you in. The palate follows this with gentle, juicy but balanced ripeness, featuring mirabelle plum and pear. There is a welcome grapefruit zestiness to the body and finish that makes this refreshing and moreish.",Türk 2015 Kremser Sandgrube Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
5652,"The lemony nose promises freshness. Tangy citrus fruits are abundant on the flowing palate, which wraps you up in its easy freshness. This is balanced, fruity and very refreshing.",Türk 2015 Kremser Wachtberg Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
5653,"This wine has that wonderful but hard-to-pin-down Zinfandel essence that's extremely fruity but also uniquely spicy and brambly. It blends together ripe raspberry, creamy vanilla and red cherry on a smooth, nicely viscous and very full-bodied frame that helps the finish linger.",Wood Family Vineyards 2014 Big Wood Zin Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
5654,"High-toned aromas of cocoa, barrel spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead to plentiful, focused fruit and barrel flavors. The flavors linger on the finish.",Airfield Estates 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
5655,"Comprised of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot, this is a juicy, savory and lengthy wine, with herbaceous elements of cedar, brush and peppercorn. A lush, full-bodied complement of baked plum and cherry ride out a lengthy finish.",Ancient Oak Cellars 2012 Reserve Series Alcaeus Berger Vineyard Red (Sonoma Mountain)
5656,"There is tons of potential for this varietal in the hot eastern reaches of Paso Robles. Light peach and Pink Lady apple aromas start off the easy-to-enjoy nose. The palate shows more layers, starting with ripe peach and then firming up on citrus pith, sour apple and tangy pear. A gravelly minerality and rising texture on the finish complete the picture.",Broken Earth 2015 Verdelho (Paso Robles)
5657,"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel.",Township 7 2015 Blue Terrace Vineyard Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Okanagan Valley)
5658,"Light in color and body, this is a cool-climate-influenced wine full of spice and life. It offers a mixture of rhubarb, strawberry and black tea, dusted in cardamom. The wine's spicy tones carry through to the medium-length finish.",Balletto 2014 Sexton Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
5659,"Richly structured this wine, from well-exposed vines (hence the land of light in the name) is fruity with black cherry and some firm tannins. It is going to develop into a serious, complex wine. Drink from 2018.",Château de Chatelard 2015 Cuvée Terre de Lumière  (Moulin-à-Vent)
5660,"Finding new varietals is always fun, and this take on an ancient grape from Campania, Italy, offers promise in warm Temecula. Crisp Anjou and Asian pears show on the nose, along with salt, Gala apple, white flowers and gravel. Sharp citrus appears on the palate, with lime pith, pink-grapefruit juice and a chalky, seashell component.",Cougar 2015 Falanghina (Temecula Valley)
5661,"Made with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this bold wine opens with aromas of black currant, cedar and exotic spice. The concentrated palate delivers blueberry jam, graphite, anise and clove alongside assertive tannins that leave a firm finish.",Donna Olimpia 1898 2013 Millepassi  (Bolgheri)
5662,"Aromas of vanilla, baking spice, wood spice and pitch-black fruit are followed by power-packed fruit and barrel flavors. The oak is primary at present. Give it time to integrate. Best after 2021.",Dusted Valley 2013 Petite Sirah (Wahluke Slope)
5663,"From entirely estate-grown fruit and blended with 5% Cabernet Franc, this is a soft, full and well-structured wine, sanguine in currant, cassis and a dusting of brambly raspberry. Inviting, it finishes in a pleasing note of mocha.",Ehlers Estate 2013 Merlot (St. Helena)
5664,"The winery's annual stainless-steel bottling, this is showy rather than reserved, with ripe Asian pear, tropical flowers, sweet apple blossoms, pineapple and a bit of vanilla on the nose. Nicely fresh, it's bright on the palate, with a sizzle of acidity and grippy chalkiness that frame the poached-pear palate.",Foley 2014 Steel Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
5665,"From an small estate that also has vines in Chénas and Saint-Amour, this is a firmly tannic wine that also has attractive juicy red-berry fruits. The wine, still young, will repay aging allowing it to broaden out with rich fruit and a soft texture. Drink this cru from late 2017.",Georges Duboeuf 2015 Domaine de Roche Noire  (Moulin-à-Vent)
5666,"An initial hit of reduction blows off to reveal rich vanilla backed by gentle lemon purity. This clearly needs some time in bottle to find its middle but all the basics are there: freshness, clean fruit, texture and poise. Drink 2028–2025.",Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2014 Chardonnay (Leithaberg)
5667,"A surprising 30% of this wine is Clairette, a white grape variety. Perhaps that accounts for the wine's apparent freshness. Hints of crushed stone mark the nose, while the ripe flavors suggest peaches and berries, tailing away slowly on the finish. Drink this mouthfilling rosé over the rest of 2017.",Chateau de Manissy 2015 Cuvée de Lys  (Tavel)
5668,"Fresh aromas, vivid citrus flavors, elegance and poise make this an attractive wine. It has a balance that is easy to enjoy and keeps calling for more sips, with pleasant notes of citrus and green fruit throughout.",Murphy-Goode 2015 The Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast)
5669,"Deep color and lots of concentration make this full-bodied wine stand out. It has smoky, black-peppery aromas along with ripe but not sweet blackberry and black-cherry flavors. Firm tannins add texture. This boldness needs rich food for a pairing.",Naggiar 2014 Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills)
5670,"Aromas of black currant and a whiff of bell pepper slowly emerge on this hearty blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. Concentrated and robust, the palate offers cassis, black cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside big velvety tannins.",Poggio al Tesoro 2013 Sondraia  (Bolgheri Superiore)
5671,"Wonderfully heady hints of yuzu play about the nose. The palate, on the other hand, is characterized by ripe juicy mirabelle plums. This is plump and opulent, yet structured: a rounded and generous souvenir of the 2015 vintage.",Rainer Wess 2015 Pfaffenberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
5672,"Toast with apricot jam comes first to mind in this nicely balanced white that begins in richness and evolves in the glass to offer a freshness of lime zest and grapefruit, the minerality well-defined.",Robert Mondavi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)
5673,"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan.",Ryan Cochrane 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
5674,"Candied—almost confected—red fruit shimmers on the nose. On the palate, this turns into fleshy aromatic red cherry that carries immediate charm. The palate is light, refreshing and full of easy fruit. The finish is clean and reinforces that lovely cherry note.",Stift Klosterneuburg 2014 Steinfeld Pinot Noir (Thermenregion)
5675,"The varietal is unmistakable, with generous amounts of freshly ground black pepper along with lemon twist, herb and raw meat. The medium-bodied palate brings more of the same, with fruit and savory flavors that provide intrigue.",Telaya 2014 Mourvèdre

5677,"This is an impressive blend of 45% Merlot with 25% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah from Stagecoach Vineyard and 10% Biale Zinfandel. It comes together seamlessly in a twist of structured blackberry, leathery tannin and tomato leaf, priced to be enjoyed by many.",Jax 2014 Y3 Taureau Red (Napa Valley)
5678,"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle. What's already there is cassis, tar and earth, finishing with a light but balanced fade.",Milbrandt 2007 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope)
5679,"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",Milbrandt 2009 Evergreen Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
5680,"At just 12.5% alcohol, this comes across as dry and quite fresh, with vivid grapefruit flesh and acidity. Some mint and lemon flavors sneak in also. The emphasis is clearly on citrus rather than peach or apricot; a fine food wine.",Milbrandt 2009 Traditions Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
5681,"Fresh wine, touched by late harvest richness. Apples, spice and orange zest make for a vividly aromatic series of delicious flavors.",Neumeister 2009 Gelber Muskateller Klassik Gelber Muskateller (Südoststeiermark)
5682,"A crisp style of Riesling, with freshly perfumed green fruits and a steely edge. Flavors of white currants and green plums finish with vivid acidity.",Norbert Bauer 2009 Diermannsee Riesling (Niederösterreich)
5683,"A bit of a letdown after a string of riper, more successful vintages. Feels sharp and somewhat herbal, with a hay or dried wheat edge to the black cherry and rhubarb fruit. Could just be going through a tough period, and might emerge on the other side in 5–6 years.",Testarossa 2008 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California)
5684,"Smoke, ash and graphite notes form an elegant frame to wild berries, orange zest and blue flowers. Cherry wood and mesquite appear in the mouth and the wine is capped by tight, drying tannins.",Angelo Negro & Figli 2006 Sudisfà Riserva  (Roero)
5685,"This youthful expression of Barbera comes forth with ripe and raw aromas of black fruit, plum, prune and wild berries. You really feel the freshness of the fruit here and this wine would pair perfectly with pasta or pizza.",Damilano 2009  Barbera d'Asti
5686,"This is a heavy, full-bodied wine, with the weight of a Rhône variety, perhaps Grenache. Purists will criticize it for lacking the elegance you want in an expensive Pinot Noir. It's dry and tannic, with deep flavors of red currants, cherries, licorice, Canadian bacon and peppery spices. Could develop in the bottle, but it's risky.",Firefly Night 2008 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
5687,"Shows the exotic fruitiness of Viognier, with a blast of tangerines, pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples, with flowery honeysuckle and jasmine notes. The wine shows subtle oak notes, but is mainly notable for its forward flavors, elegant dryness and crisply bright acidity.",Kunde 2008 Viognier (Sonoma Valley)
5688,"Almonds and toasted bread combine with lemon and honey flavors in this well-balanced off-dry wine. The acidity reminds you this is Champagne, while keeping fruit and softness right up front.",Louis Barthélémy NV Opale Demi-Sec  (Champagne)
5689,"A soft wine that is full of strawberry fruits to go with a sweet citrus edge. The wine has good acidity, in a light apéritif style with pure final raspberry juice.",Mailly Grand Cru NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
5690,"This light and compact Barbaresco Riserva offers ethereal notes of spice, root beer, white berry and wet earth. There's a hint of clove, cinnamon and natural rubber as well and the wine is smooth, polished and firm on the close.",Nada Giuseppe 2005 Casot Riserva  (Barbaresco)
5691,"Here's an easy-drinking expression of Nebbiolo that sees 12 months of wood aging in large oak casks for extra spice and tobacco on the finish. Otherwise, the freshness of the fruit is what you taste here backed by bright acidity and firm tannins.",Pioiero 2007  Nebbiolo d'Alba
5692,"This is a decadently rich Chardonnay, although it depends for its appeal mainly on oak and ripe fruit, rather than nuance. Explodes with pineapple jam, golden mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors. Ready now.",Riverbench 2008 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
5693,"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017.",Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine  (Lalande de Pomerol)
5694,"Coming from the same stable as Léoville las Cases in Saint-Julien, the wine is finely structured with firm tannins and dark fruit. Rich plum flavors are counterbalanced by solid tannins. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.",Château Potensac 2011  Médoc
5695,"A hearty Brunello, it opens with aromas that recall meat juices, leather, mature black fruit cooking spices and turned earth. The juicy palate offers ripe black cherry accented with notes of black pepper, raspberry and lemon thyme with a hint of creamy vanilla. It's velvety soft and already accessible so enjoy soon.",Citille di Sopra 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
5696,"This spicy, elegant take on Syrah will reward your attention. Boysenberry and other purple/black fruits are expressed both aromatically and on the palate, with light touches of vanilla. The overall impression is of a pretty, structured, textural wine, with excellent length and balance.",DaMa 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
5697,"The 2011 and 2012 Chardonnays from DaMa are a study in contrasts, showing how very different the vintages were. Both come from Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes, but in 2012 the wine has more floral highlights, and a vertical crispness to its structure. Flavors of anise, green apple and pear are wound up in the tight frame, and this would appear to have some years of life ahead.",DaMa 2012 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
5698,"The finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check.",Gamache 2011 Estate Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
5699,"Half was whole-cluster fermented, yielding dense scents and flavors with black olive, herb and a touch of mocha. Cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are smooth and detailed, and the tannins firm and polished.",Amavi 2011 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5700,"This earthy wine opens with aromas of meat juices, baking spices and black fruit together with notes of leather and balsam. The rich palate delivers dark red cherry layered with mint and a tad of milk chocolate alongside dusty tannins. It' well balanced and should age moderately well. Drink 2016–2024.",Bolsignano 2009 Grazia  (Brunello di Montalcino)
5701,"A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance.",Bouchaine 2012 Bouche d'Or Chardonnay (Carneros)
5702,"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018.",Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
5703,"An unlikely but enticing mix of woodsmoke and citrus, of earthiness and lemon oil already hint at the complexity of this nutty wine. A central seam of acidity brings spicy, almost soy-sauce-like savoriness and a bruised-apple edge into focus and suggests that this is best drunk with hearty food.",Johanneshof Reinisch 2012 Spiegel Zierfandler (Thermenregion)
5704,"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.",Villadoria 2004 Riserva  (Barolo)
5705,"This excellent Merlot speaks to many of Reininger's proven strengths. It's quite smooth and supple, loaded with ripe plum and cherry fruit, seamless and chocolaty. The balance is right on, the length and texture captivating.",Reininger 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5706,"A pure varietal Syrah, this opens with a mix of peppery herbs, a hint of stem, and a whiff of tomato leaf. Give it some breathing room and the red currant fruit fleshes out, melding with darker flavors of licorice, soy and espresso, in a wine of medium length, with natural acidity and crisp tannins.",Reininger 2010 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
5707,"The proportions favor Grenache 55% to 45%. Four vineyards from three widely different AVAs contributed grapes, yielding compelling aromas of wild berry, raw meat and a brambly character. This is a wine that wants you to take a walk on the wild side, so put on some Lou Reed while you enjoy it.",Syncline 2011 Grenache-Carignan (Columbia Valley (WA))
5708,"Aloe vera, green pear peel and ripe Mirabelle plums charm nose and palate on the soft and ripe palate. Despite the ripeness nothing is overdone and reaches a center of gravity.",Tegernseerhof 2012 Bergdistel Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
5709,"Blackberry, blueberry and creamy vanilla aromas comprise a sweet, chunky, very ripe bouquet. The mouthfeel is full, succulent and bouncy, while flavors of creamy oak, baking spices and black fruits finish with juicy acidity and plenty of wood, chocolate and licorice notes. 150 cases made; drink through 2018.",TeHo 2012 Malbec (Mendoza)

5711,"20% whole-cluster fermented, this rich, brooding blend of Alder Ridge (86%) and Snipes Mountain Grenache brings notes of licorice, dark cherry, black pepper and mortared herbs. It's broad in feel, tart, fruit filled, and tightly wound, needing time in the cellar to unfurl.",Kerloo 2011 Grenache (Horse Heaven Hills)
5712,"This is a good price for a Cabernet this rich and satisfying. It's dry, tannic and opulent in blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a complex note of green olives. It's fully ready to drink now.",Kirkland Signature 2011 Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
5713,"Round and velvety, it has aromas of ripe berry, chocolate and exotic spices. The rich palate delivers juicy black cherry punctuated with ground black pepper, cinnamon, carob, pipe tobacco and mint. Forward and sweet, this is already extremely accessible so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018.",La Poderina 2008 Poggio Abate Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
5714,"Made entirely with Syrah, this concentrated wine delivers plum, black pepper, cocoa, coffee, fleshy black cherry and notes of bay leaf. It's plush, soft and savory but it also seems shy on vibrancy and essential energy. Drink sooner rather than later.",Le Macchiole 2010 Scrio Syrah (Toscana)
5715,"An impressive wine, it already shows signs of its potential. It is elegant, with ripe fruits and layers of dark tannins. As it opens, blackberry fruits come through strongly, balancing the firm structure. Drink from 2018.",Château Beaumont 2011  Haut-Médoc

The tannins are now softening, giving a rich structure plus a concentrated leather and spice character. Drink from 2016.",Château Clément-Pichon 2010  Haut-Médoc
5717,"Spicy new wood flavors dominate this otherwise strongly fruity wine. The tension between the two promises a rich, full and ripe wine for the future. There is enough weight, acidity, blackberry fruit and richness to balance out the wood aging. Give this dense wine until 2018.",Château Fonréaud 2011  Listrac-Médoc
5718,"Firm and closed this is a dark and tannic wine, although black currant flavors are also very present. It feels austere with a mineral texture and concentrated final acidity. Drink Lafite's second wine from 2017.",Château Lafite Rothschild 2011 Carruades de Lafite  (Pauillac)

5720,"This structured wine is the second wine of Château Montrose. It is balanced, the smooth, fresh fruits and plum-skin texture making it already accessible. With its juicy aftertaste, it will be ready to drink soon.",Château Montrose 2011 La Dame de Montrose  (Saint-Estèphe)
5721,"Structured and elegant, this lovely Pinot Grigio opens with delicate scents of white Alpine flower, citrus and a whiff of herb.

Bright acidity provides lift and balance.",Abbazia di Novacella 2015 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige Valle Isarco)

5723,"Bursting with citrus and savory aromas, this wine is an extrovert that layers spicy, herbal notes on top of ripe and delicious melon and citrus flavors.

5724,"Sharp lime skins, rich petrol and yellow grapefruit juice combine for that familiarly fresh Riesling aroma, yet this one is a tad richer, with a lemon pastry note.

5726,"This offers aromas of wild berry, baking spice, toast and a floral note. On the firm palate, notes of vanilla, clove and powdered sage accent a sour cherry core alongside nervous acidity.

5727,"Ripe blueberries, toasted oak, caramel, brown coffee, black pepper and crushed grape seeds combine for a pleasant smoke and fruit combo on the nose of this bottling.

5729,"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced.",Iron Horse 2013 Q Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
5730,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (91%) along with pinches of Syrah and Merlot. The aromas of espresso, coffee grounds, fresh herbs and cherry pop, but don't always seem entirely harmonious. The black fruit flavors are more reserved than the aromas might suggest but still deliver.",J. Bookwalter 2013 Chapter 6 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
5731,"Almost white in color, this wine takes the Provence fashion for light rosé to extremes. To taste, yes, it is a rosé with a light tannic edge and red-currant flavors.

5734,"With 60% Mourvèdre, this blend is rich and spicy. It has great acidity, still fresh and accented by red and citrus fruits.

5752,"There's a very savory, gamy element on the nose of this wine, which shows wild berries, woody shrubs, rusty iron and turned forest-floor aromas.

5764,"There is a distinct phenolic edge on this earthy, lemon-dominated and taut Riesling. Fruit—apart from citrus—is subsumed into an earthy, tense and concentrated palate.

5766,"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple.

5787,"Damp and furry on the nose, this is all tannins and scratch. High acidity only contributes to the grating mouthfeel, hence it's a bumpy ride where standard berry flavors are a sideshow. Chento 2012 is a better bet if it's still on the shelf.",Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2013 Chento Malbec (Mendoza)

5966,"Here's a sweet white wine (the term Amabile refers to the high sugar content) that opens with compelling notes of honey, acacia flower, peach and yellow candy. It's hard to imagine what to pair it with: It could either go with fruit salad or salty crackers with cheese.",Bigi 2009 Amabile  (Orvieto Classico)
5967,A rather dull nose does not want to reveal much. The palate counters this with freshness and a rosehip tartness that has some bitter-edged redcurrant charm. This is fresh and easy and would also work as a chilled red.,Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Les Princes Abbés Pinot Noir (Alsace)
5968,"Red fruit dominates this attractive, light wine that shows the acidity of the year while also suggesting light tannins. The aftertaste has a touch of smokiness. It will develop quickly.",Faiveley 2014  Bourgogne

Drink now.",Lismore Range 2015 Reserve Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)

6001,"It's great to return to an excellent honest-tasting fruit-driven wine that has very good balance, an appetizing texture thanks to fine-grained tannins and light spicy elements to complement the pure cherry and berry core.

6007,"The wine is rich, exuding ripe black fruits as well as dried prune. It balances the fruit with some firm tannins that will allow the wine to age for a few years. For now, it is opulent, finely balanced, and leaves a fine perfumed aftertaste from the Touriga Nacional in the blend.",Offley 2013 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
6008,"Deep garnet to the eye, this wine offers a nose of black cherry, cassis and butterscotch.

6012,"Black cherry and black currant open the nose on this bottling, but there are more savory components of soy and black pepper lurking in the background. The palate is lively with black raspberry before the chalky, still quite stiff tannins arise, carrying flashes of cigar box, pencil shavings and bittersweet chocolate.",Russian Ridge 2013 Martin Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
6013,"This Port was bottled unfiltered which means there are the right conditions for it to age. It is rich and dense with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins.

6014,"Look for the tiny e.6 on the label, indicating that this nonvintage blend is the sixth edition. The blend includes Syrah, Sangiovese and Montepulciano, and it's truly inspired.

6017,"This wine starts with a creamy nose of apricot, banana and orangesicle but then a more oxidative quality comes through of slightly sour guava and pineapple. It's tight and tart on the sip, combining banana, guava and macadamia nut richness with grapefruit peel sourness. It's an interesting and unique wine.",Stolpman 2016 Estate Grown Roussanne (Ballard Canyon)
6018,"This is a powerhouse of a wine, from a tremendous coastal site, situated within a blanket of forest at 1,200-feet elevation.

6019,"This bottling explores the more concentrated side of Pinot Noir, with hearty aromas of balsamic fig sauce, cooked berries, clove and rum cake.

6023,"Made from two vineyards in the appellation, this shows black cherry, cedar and tobacco, with a graphite element not far behind.

6027,"Rich, complex and quite leesy, it has a mature aroma and texture to it—it’s almost thick and doughy. The fruit is in the orange and grapefruit range, with a bit of pear poking through. It’s a good idiosyncratic Champagne, but it may not be for everyone, as it definitely has a mature style all its own.",Bollinger NV Special Cuvée Brut  (Champagne)
6028,"Starts off with softly perfumed cherries and dried leaves, then turns strongly piny on the palate. Finishes long, with tart cranberry and bitter-chocolate notes. Some excellent elements, including a lush yet structured mouthfeel, but some tasters will find the intense pine-bough flavor distracting.",Torii Mor 1998 Balcombe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6029,"Really nicely balanced, this is a big, sleek cruiser with lemon, earth and green-apple aromas and flavors. Full, yet trim and clean, it shows the tautness of youth but has fine essential fruit and a lengthy, crisp finish. Possesses excellent, if somewhat unopened elements, and may well rate higher if cellared for a few years",Vranken 1995 Demoiselle Cuvée 21  (Champagne)
6030,"Snappy and full of raspberry and cedar aromas. It’s mouthfilling and juicy, with a stylish lean edge to it. Puckery on the palate, with a right-on mix of acidity, fruit and oak. It delivers the goods, not missing a twist or turn along the way, and in the final analysis, it’s fairly large, packing a solid punch of berry fruit.",Erath 1998 Vintage Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6031,"Quite Burgundian in nature, this offering is not opulent, but is very well defined, with an almost etched nature. Lean, with tart cherry, licorice and mineral aromas and flavors, and fairly light in body, it is big on character and traditonal Pinot style. The wine is quite taut now, but the finish is very long and complex. Should be beautiful with three to five years’ aging.",Evesham Wood 1998 Temperance Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6032,"Dough, vanilla, apple and citrus aromas open to a smooth palate offering similar flavors with smoky, spicy accents. Quite fizzy; there’s a slightly soft quality to it, and a tangy element enters on the finish of this charming easy drinker.",De Saint Gall 1995 Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut  (Champagne)
6033,"Light straw in color, with fine bubbles and pure, fine aromas of peach and strawberry. In the mouth, it’s exceptionally rich and creamy. It’s not quite as sweet as an extra dry Champagne, but it’s definitely heading in that direction.",Iron Horse 1995 Russian Cuvée  (Sonoma County)
6034,"A burly surprise from southern Oregon; there are flowery, almost honeyed elements to the black-fruit nose. It scores big points in the mouthfeel category—it’s round, chewy and creamy. Oak is a giant factor here; you’d better like mounds of toasty wood. If you do, the plump plummy fruit will make your day. But stand clear of this hefster if you prefer elegant, streamlined Pinot Noir.",Bear Creek 1998 Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley)
6035,"Blackberry, herb, tobacco and a menthol note mark the nose of this full but not heavy red. The fruit is ripe, sweet and unburdened by excess oak. The long, juicy cherry and licorice finish sports no hard tannins. Lovely for drinking now.",Heritage Road 1998 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Limestone Coast)
6036,"Compared to the Mazzoni, this baby has less fruity but pepperier, earthier aromas, and herbal ones, too: licorice and chocolate, although there’s some deeply scented blackberry. It seems crisper and more angular, and more tannic, with a great hidden depth of fruit that needs to be coaxed out through short-term aging.",Kenwood 1997 Nuns Canyon Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
6037,"Has bright, focused aromas, including lime and raspberry, with nutty, smoky bread dough and yeast. Very clean, with a pronounced kiss of sweet berry fruit. Finishes slightly sweet.",Robert Hunter 1994 Brut de Noirs  (Sonoma Valley)
6038,"An elegant, pale-golden color leads to subtle but refined aromas of bread dough and lime, and a tantalizing hint of—what? Mint? Raspberry? White chocoloate? The same flavors commingle in the mouth. It’s very dry and acidic now. A year or so might soften it.",Roederer Estate NV Brut  (Anderson Valley)
6039,"Toast and yeast on the otherwise lime-scented bouquet. Clean citrus and green-apple flavors lead into a zesty, smooth soda-like finish. Overall it’s just a nice, clean, bright Champagne, one that has the right level of dryness and zip.",G. H. Mumm NV Cordon Rouge Brut  (Champagne)
6040,"The very ripe and sweet cherry aromas and flavors bear handsome notes of tarragon and smoke.

Quite appealing now and very easy to get comfy with.",Stonecroft 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6041,"Each year Rich gets his grapes from different sources: This time it’s Corral Creek, and the wine’s tight as a drum, emphasizing cranberry and pie cherries. It isn’t sour, but it is tart. The gorgeous nose and precise, powerful red-berry fruit make it pleasurable. Puckering acids say it should be served with food.",Andrew Rich 1998 Les Vigneaux Corral Creek Vyd Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6042,"For those who like their Pinot oaky, this may be just the ticket. It starts out with caramel, coffee and chocolate aromas skillfully matched with sour cherries and a bouquet garni of green herbs. It then turns ever oakier on the palate, with a near-syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with toasty oak-driven spice notes and an herbaceous edge.",Argyle 1998 Spirit House Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6043,"Starts with a nice gold-straw color and lots of fine, tiny bubbles. The aroma is rich and creamy, marked by pear and apple notes, vanilla and bread dough. Very dry, with evident ripe fruit and a dry, leesy finish. The texture’s a bit rough, but this may age out in a few years.",Handley 1994 Blanc De Blancs  (Anderson Valley)
6044,"Attractive fragrance and a pleasureable mouthfeel characterize this medium-weight offering. A 50-50 Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc blend, it offers  pear, lemon, and vanilla-oak flavors on the nose and mouth. The long smooth finish is unexpectedly elegant, something not often found at this price. Best Buy.",Calvet 1998 Reserve  (Bordeaux Blanc)
6045,"Bright in color and full of snappy cherries on the nose. This cherry-dominated profile follows suit on the palate, where the fruit-to-wood-balance swings in favor of the crisp, dry fruit. Charged-up acids provide a jolt, as do the full tannins. It seems to have the right structure to age for a few years.",Tualatin Estate 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6046,"Dark in color, almost pure purple; the bouquet carries some heavy oak, with aromas of toast and vanilla. It’s also a little sauvage. Rich and chocolaty, but also quite sweet. It’s deep and woody overall—the vanilla and oak are very prominent, maybe too much so for many people.",Cristom 1998 Louise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6047,"Chocolate and plum mingle enticingly in this medium-bodied offering from the warm (relative to Willamette) Umpqua Valley. Subtle herb notes and a peppery, crisp finish keep this wine interesting from start to finish.",Girardet 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
6048,"From a bubbly specialist comes this fancy wine, a blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay. Has very forward fruity aromas that are a combo of both varietals. It’s a bit rough, as though the bubbles aren’t fine enough, but that’s comparing it to the best French vintage Champagne, which costs a whole lot more.",Handley 1995 Brut  (Anderson Valley)
6049,"Fruit-forward is the best way to describe this juicy, totally accessible red. Rich berry flavors, just a faint meaty-leathery note for a touch of complexity, and a smooth even finish complete the package. Best Buy.",Heritage Road 1998 Shiraz (South Australia)
6050,"Marked by strong, bright citrus and vanilla aromas, and a waft of freshly kneaded bread dough and toast, this charming wine has limeade flavors with a toasty finish. It’s dry and has class and refinement.",Gloria Ferrer 1992 Royal Cuvee Brut  (Carneros)
6051,"This organic bottling marks Cooper’s 20th year, and it’s a tantalizing, high-strung, dusty wine, with a true Pinot nose full of raspberries and cinnamon. Plenty of verve on the palate, which emphasizes fruit and more fruit. The frame is sleek, but it capably carries the wine’s zip.",Cooper Mountain 1998 20th Anniversary Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6052,"A nice young, jammy Zin with zesty aromas of blackberry jam and briary fruit, meaning it’s like the scent of wild berries on a hot summer day. A lovely wine with pretty fruit, but it’s most notable for the soft, plush, opulent tannins.",Fetzer 1997 Barrel Select Zinfandel (Mendocino County)
6053,"Smells like a briar patch under summer sun, with accents of leather and tomato. The pungent aromatics fade into a weighty mouthfeel. It’s all red berries, and it’s tight and young. Shows fine structure and a pure quality. A very likable wine.",Elk Cove 1998 Windhill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6054,"Rustic, with some smoke and char up front that gives way to intense berry flavors. It’s a touch idiosyncratic—it’s very concentrated and a bit sauvage—as it shows a lot of vineyard individuality. Hard and rugged now; a few years in the bottle should tame its power.",Adelsheim 1998 Bryan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)

Drink now.",Mas des Bressades 2008 Cuvée Tradition Rosé (Costières de Nîmes)
6157,"With a ruby-crimson color, this sparkling wine is as full-bodied as a Pinot Noir, but with bubbles. It has flavors of strawberries, vanilla and yeast, and is dry and clean. Nice with ahi tuna tartare.",Frank Family NV Rouge Sparkling (Napa Valley)
6158,"Soft and gentle, this is a Zin to drink right now for its lush, exotic flavors. It's dry, with dusty tannins and mouth-filling tastes of ripe crushed blackberries and cherries, baked into a pie and sprinkled with cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper, with a pinch of salt.",Hobo 2007 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
6159,"Here's a Dry Prosecco (in other words, sweeter) from the Cartizze cru that plays its sweet fruit flavors against attractive mineral notes.

The mouthfeel is tonic and sharp with crisp acidity.",Le Colture NV Cartizze  (Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze)

Could benefit from 2 or 3 years in the cellar.",Brassfield 2005 Round Mountain Volcano Zinfandel (High Valley)
6161,"Ripe, creamy and decidedly fruity, this has a big waft of herbaceous, citrus and green plum flavors that are all up front and delicious. The wood element gives spice, offering a base for the fruit and giving good balance, and a vibrant, clean aftertaste.",Château du Seuil 2007  Graves
6162,"Powerful and rich, from superripe grapes, this wine follows a style in Bordeaux that seems to want to make white Burgundy. It is creamy, rounded, spicy from toast, with white fruits, only a touch of citrus, and a full, intense aftertaste.",Château Tour de Mirambeau 2007  Bordeaux Blanc

It's a well-balanced wine, with clean, fresh flavors and just the right amount of acid to keep you reaching for the next glass.",Boedecker Cellars 2007 Purity Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
6165,"With its ripe, yellow fruit flavors, this is a gentle, soft, open wine, which offers immediately pleasure. There is more: the spice from the wood and the pear skin and nutmeg element adding complexity. That suggests aging for 2–3 years, possibly more. But also enjoy now.",Château de Cruzeau 2007  Pessac-Léognan
6166,"A lovely bottle, carefully crafted from vines approaching 40 years of age. A third of the wine was fermented in neutral barrels, softening the mouthfeel a bit, and kept on the lees for almost five months.

Stylish and lacy.",Daedalus Cellars 2007 Maresh Vineyard Riesling (Dundee Hills)

6169,"This is only just rosé, its onion skin color as pale as possible. The wine has some red fruit flavors, but it is more about toast, yeast and a lively, smooth finish. Worth considering with salamis or ham, as well as salmon.",Louis Barthélémy NV Pink Brut  (Champagne)

6226,"Adding Syrah (Shiraz as the producer calls it) to the blend with Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional gives a strongly perfumed character to this firm, still structured wine.

6262,"Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec—a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis. It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling.",Leonetti Cellar 2010 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
6263,"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
6264,"While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of “only the darkest, most extracted lots,” from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak. It is absolutely delicious now, but the tannin structure guarantees to develop for 10–20 years.",Von Strasser 2010 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
6265,"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.",Von Strasser 2010 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
6266,"Black and viscous, this gorgeous Petite Sirah is intriguing in every way. Opening with aromas of just-muddled mint and freshly baked bread, this wine tastes as if wildflowers and brambly blackberry stems were placed carefully in a leather satchel. No doubt this Petite will get even more interesting with age.",Sirius 2010 Eaglepoint Ranch Petite Sirah (Mendocino County)
6267,"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard. Deeply concentrated, complex and creamy, it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits, honey and butterscotch, yet remains lifted by defining acidity.",Stottle 2011 Lucille Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley)
6268,"Dense and extracted, this dark, loamy Pinot Noir is concentrated and challenging. The fruit is black, compact, and sheathed in flavors of loam. Layers are tight and a bit unyielding. There is depth and power here, but it must be extracted over time and with a bit of patience.",Dr. Loosen & J. Christopher 2007 Appassionata Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6269,"Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit, as concentrated and pure as anything in California. The acidity is beautiful, as you'd expect from this vineyard in such a cool vintage, and it showcases Pinot Noir's silkiness and beauty. Despite the immediate flash,  it will develop bottle complexity; hold until 2016.",Gary Farrell 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
6270,"This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.",Silverado 2009 Limited Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
6271,"Capture continues to make progress in interpreting their vineyard located in this new appellation, a high elevation overlooking Alexander Valley. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors, while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009, and a wine to cellar for 8–10 years, if not longer.",Captûre 2010 Harmonie Red (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak)
6272,"Perfumed on the nose with heady yellow florals and stonefruit, this is one stunner of a Riesling. It's powerfully concentrated on the palate with flavors of honey and sweet peach tinged with lanolin and wax. Penetrating and pure in focus, yet remarkably delicate in texture, it finishes long with layers of crushed-stone minerality.",Markus Molitor 2010 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
6273,"All Leonetti wines are 100% estate-grown fruit, mixing Seven Hills, Mill Creek Upland and Loess vineyard grapes. The 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon includes 12% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot and 4% Carmenère in the blend. Young and chewy, with a hint of herbaceousness, this shows lovely balance and a mix of raspberry, black cherry, cassis, coffee and cacao. It's a young, deep and powerful wine that will certainly reward cellaring.",Leonetti Cellar 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
6274,"Ignore its generic Oregon AVA—this is King Estate's top wine, a rich reserve-level Pinot Noir redolent with Asian spices, saffron, cumin and more. Nuances of dusty cocoa powder lead into a thrilling wine with a spine of steel, focusing its ripe, fleshy fruit through a long, cellar-worthy finish.",King Estate 2009 Domaine Pinot Noir (Oregon)
6275,"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years.",Lynmar 2011 La Serenité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
6276,"Produced from four vineyards throughout the valley, this Cabernet shows the art of the blend. It's softly tannic and frankly delicious, with dazzlingly rich blackberry, cassis liqueur, anise and mineral flavors. Hard to describe how attractive this wine is now.",Sequum 2009 Four Soil Melange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
6277,"If there's one California Pinot Noir you cellar this vintage, make it this one. It's a stone-cold guarantee. Light and silky in the mouth, with brisk acidity, it shows rich raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors that are deep and long. Has all the necessary balance to evolve many years, and should start showing bottle development after 2018.",Calera 2010 Selleck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan)
6278,"This exceptional wine was made by the late David Lett to celebrate the birth of his granddaughter. It's drinking beautifully, and has the color and scent of a mature wine, though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them. Delicate and subtle, it nonetheless shows surpassing power and length. Mature, fully-evolved dried fruit and herb flavors are highlighted with notes of cinnamon and brown sugar.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2000 Marguerite Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
6279,"Shows the Von Strasser signature all down the line, with incredibly extracted blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and new French oak flavors, wrapped into hard tannins and brightened with fine acidity. Only the second release from this young vineyard, it's an intensely interesting, complex wine that will reward cellaring. Best after 2019.",Von Strasser 2010 Vineyard 2131 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
6280,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",Lynmar 2011 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
6281,"This is McCrea's top cuvée, and the 2008 is as good as it has ever been. Co-fermented with 8% Viognier, it starts out tight and compact, with crisp marionberry fruit and a generous wash of coffee liqueur. The acids are citrusy and fresh, and the wine has depth and an emotional range that reaches almost symphonic power.",McCrea Cellars 2008 Cuvée Orleans Syrah (Yakima Valley)
6282,"A delicately structured, low-alcohol Pinot from the Sonoma Coast that shows winemaker Ehren Jordan's increasing fascination with this part of Sonoma County. The wine is light in texture, with savory wild cherry, licorice, sweet tobacco, mocha, bacon and spice flavors. That sounds like a wild assortment,  but somehow it all comes together, in a wine of singular focus and discernment. Drink now–2020.",Failla 2011 Whistler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
6283,"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",Gary Farrell 2010 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
6284,"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",Captûre 2010 Révélation Cabernet Sauvignon (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak)
6285,"Insanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors. Somehow, the mass is reined in by a tight framework of acids, minerals and oak tannins. This shows the pedigree that comes from this famous vineyard, as well as the Williams Selyem signature of extreme class and deliciousness. Drink over the next five years.",Williams Selyem 2011 Olivet Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
6286,"This Cab doesn't taste especially Spring Mountain-ish. It could come from anywhere, with its jammy red cherry, mocha and oak flavors that veer into raisins. Soft and a bit hot, it provides pleasant drinking now.",Chateau Chevalier 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
6287,"Red plum and scratchy, herbal aromas form a decent bouquet. This Cab is modest and edgy in feel, with equally raw and edgy red-berry flavors that finish quick and punchy.",Acordeón 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
6288,"This simple wine gets the basic Zin concept across, offering briary cherry, red currant, spice and oak flavors. It offers good value in a dry, medium-bodied wine that will drink well with a vast array of food.",Alexander Valley Vineyards 2011 Sin Zin Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
6289,"Firmly tannic, this is a structured wine that now lacks fruitiness. It needs to be drunk now.",Château d'Arlay 2007 Pinot Noir (Côtes du Jura)
6290,"A smoky wine with black currant flavors that bring together spice and fruitiness. The wine has a light touch, licorice and stalky tannins ending with attractive juiciness. It is ready to drink.",DFJ Vinhos 2011 Bigode Red (Lisboa)
6291,"With a touch of herbaceousness and a rounded texture, this is a simple and fruity wine. Light chalkiness in the texture indicates the only complexity.",Drouet Frères 2012 La Forcine  (Sancerre)
6292,Baked strawberry and raspberry aromas carry onto the medium-bodied palate. Fine chalky tannins and bright acids lend the toasted herb flavor structural support.,Miracle Valley 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia)
6293,"The dense aromas of raisin, panettone and dark cherry are of medium intensity. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is soft and malleable, and it ends with flavors of cherry cola and dark raspberry.",Prince Michel 2009 Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
6294,"For the price, this blend of five varieties is a pretty good value. It's oaky and full-bodied in blackberries and cherries, although a streak of green unripeness runs right down the middle.",Raymond 2012 R Collection Lot No. 7 Field Blend Red (California)
6295,"Maderized in color, this Viognier shows powdery aromas of lychee and tropical fruits. The body is round, plump and soft, while flavors of pear, almond paste, lychee and chemical turn more flat and bitter the longer this sits.",Sottano 2013 Reserva 3S Viognier (Mendoza)
6296,"A vegetal note and excessive softness compromise this Petite Sirah. High alcohol gives it heat, while the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors are simple.",Thacher 2011 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
6297,"An earthy wine that has red berry fruits and acidity alongside a rustic barnyard character. There is a mineral edge to the wine as well, so maybe giving it a year will help.",Tiago Teles 2012 Gilda Red (Bairrada)
6298,"Tastes like a supermarket peach, mango and pineapple fruit-juice drink, with the headiness of alcohol. There's a subtle hint of oak in this wine that finishes on the sweet side.",Tower 15 2012 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles)
6299,"This fruity, one-dimensional wine has flavors of blackberries, brown sugar and caramelized oak. The tannins are nice and thick, suggesting grilled meats for pairings.",Truett Hurst 2012 California Square Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
6300,"If you're new to Pinot Noir and curious, but not ready to spend a lot, check this out. It gets the idea across, with a dry, silky mouthfeel and basic flavors of raspberries, red currants and oak.",Montpellier 2012 Pinot Noir (California)
6301,"Subdued aromas recall blue flower and berries, but overall the nose isn't very expressive. The one-dimensional palate offers red cherry but it's lean and short on freshness. This is starting to fade so drink now.",Natale Verga 2011  Chianti Classico
6302,"An apple fresh wine, just off dry, with attractive acidity. Floral and aromatic wine, it has a crisp aftertaste.",Marquis de la Tour NV Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux)
6303,"This is a dry style of white Port, with an aromatic character that goes through to the palate. The spirit and wine don't taste properly integrated, giving a fiery feel without much fruit. The aftertaste is bitter.",Quinta da Maritávora NV White  (Port)
6304,"This is a light, medium sweet wine with touches of acidity to go with the fragrant pear fruits. Drink now.",Remy-Pannier 2012  Vouvray
6305,"Sparse in flavor, this blend of Merlot, Zinfandel and Syrah is one-dimensional, soft in cranberry and slightly underripe.",Road i Red NV Red (California)

6307,"Charred wood, espresso and thyme aromas lead onto the medium-full palate, which is supported by sturdy tannins. This Syrah would pair well with a pulled-pork hoagie.",Anemoi 2012 Lips Syrah (Grand Valley)
6308,"This offers warm, dried-fruit aromas of prune, plum and raisin. The palate shows some subdued sour cherry and mint but it's dilute and falls apart quickly, leaving a short finish.",Colle Bereto 2011  Chianti Classico
6309,"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with acrid aromas that recall sweat and wet leaves. The palate delivers a mouthful of raw oak, roasted coffee bean and espresso. It lacks fruit richness and finishes on a bitter note of astringent wood tannins.",Vignaioli del Morellino di Scansano 2010 Riserva Roggiano  (Morellino di Scansano)

6314,"At the start the wine shows leafy aromas and a hint of burned rubber that eventually burns off. The lean palate is evolved, and while you can still detect a note of stewed prune, most of the fruit has dried up. It ends on a bitter, drying note of astringent tannins.",Natale Verga 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
6315,"Fresh and balanced, this bright savory sparkler delivers mouthfuls of green apple, white peach and lemon peel. Crisp acidity keeps it refreshing while a soft mousse gives it plenty of finesse. It has a dry juicy finish.",Andreola 2016 Dirupo Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
6316,"Wood aged during fermentation, this rich generous wine is the top cuvée from this major Saumur producer. It is rich with apple and citrus flavors backed by a touch of toastiness. The wine is towards dry with a touch of spice at the end. Drink this fine wine now.",Bouvet-Ladubay NV Trésor Brut  (Saumur)
6317,"Old vines, up to 60 years old, are the basis of this concentrated, ripe and intense wine. It is impressive and tightly wound, with layers of rich citrus fruit and a chalky texture.

A full five years old, it's starting to show a touch of age aromatically, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherry and dried herb along with sliced green pepper.

Drink now with Moroccan cuisine or stash away through 2027.",Carrick 2013 Bannockburn Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
6324,"Fresh citrus and green apple have a leafy touch and something that is reminiscent of wet stone. That taut slenderness is apparent throughout the light dry palate where lemony freshness plays the central role. The fizz is fine and creamy and leaves the mouth filled with freshness. This is vivid, has lots of verve and a clean dry finish.",Cave de Cleebourg 2014 Symphonie en P Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)

This lovely elegant sparkler has a very fine fizz and a very refreshing long dry finish.",Cave du Roi Dagobert NV Prestige Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
6326,"This is an orange wine, intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry, with comparable aromatics.

A light yet spicy licorice-inflected finish completes the experience.",Decroux 2015 Radian Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
6331,"An unusually fresh herbal note of lemon balm hovers on the nose. The palate, however, counters this with ample honeyed sweetness.

This will work well as a counterpoint to sharp blue cheeses with its medium-sweet finish.",Domaine Fernand Engel 2015 Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)

6453,"With that extra concentration that comes from low-yielding old vines, this has great depth of flavor. It has an apple flavor and crisp, citrusy acidity as well as a more toasty character. Complex and certainly ageworthy, this should keep for at least five years.",Pascal Bouchard 2010 Les Vieilles Vignes Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
6454,"Much of the fruit for this wine comes from Napa's Mount Veeder, with additions from neighboring Sonoma County and other unidentified statewide sources. Even so, this shows a Napa-esque flair, bearing softly ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with balance and richness. The winemakers and owners are the husband and wife team from Mount Veeder's Lagier-Meredith.",Punch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
6455,"Though quite different stylistically from the 2009, this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis, with touches of smoke and espresso. This is a wine to cellar while you are drinking up the delicious 2009.",Sleight of Hand 2010 Levitation Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
6456,"It's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like, but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly. Nuanced with mineral and spice notes, this has melon and apple flavors that seem to sail on a gentle sea breeze. It doesn't slam you with oak, instead it seduces with you style.",Sleight of Hand 2010 The Enchantress Old Vine Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
6457,"Sourced from a small vineyard in the The Rocks of Walla Walla, this shows classic, terroir-driven umami flavors. It's as if the fruit were soaked in seaweed, then lifted on a platform of rock. It has lovely aromatics, with a rather delicate finish that's nuanced with cherry and tar.",Sleight of Hand 2010 The Funkadelic Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
6458,"This is big in fruit, big in tannins and big in the overall impression it leaves. It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry, red currant and cola, sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H. Smith Winery, whose Pinot Noirs were magnificent and scored highly. This one seems a little heavier than Smith used to produce.",Del Dotto 2009 Cinghiale Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
6459,"Deliciously perfumed, this shows some of the structure of the vintage, along with generous raspberry and red cherry flavors. It is rich and solid, and its open character has just the right edge of dense tannins. Already approachable, but it's likely to age over several years.",Domaine Heresztyn 2010 Les Millandes Premier Cru  (Morey-Saint-Denis)
6460,"Firm, concentrated and solid, this has a tight core that's surrounded by sweeter dark-plum fruit. This is ripe and full bodied, with a definite need for aging.",Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010 Santenots Premier Cru  (Volnay)
6461,"This shows the textural depth of all the Efesté wines. A floral top note gives way to firm, dark, cassis and blackberry flavors. Light notes of herb, anise and earth are introduced and set comfortably into the lengthy finish. It has great power and flavor, with the possibility of cellaring for a decade or more.",Efeste 2009 Final-Final Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
6462,"Mostly Syrah, with some Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a succulent rosé with a marvelous mouthfeel. Texture and length are its main charms, with nuanced notes of rose petal, hibiscus, watermelon and pie cherry. The vineyard sources are Klipsun, Boushey and Ciel du Cheval.",Efeste 2011 Babbitt Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA))
6463,"Big and bold, this has noticeable alcohol and loads of chocolate, espresso and jammy black-fruit flavors. The overall muscle and brawn of the mouthfeel give balance to the heat and intensity. Pair this with aged cheese or grilled steak.",Fabiano 2005 I Fondatori Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
6464,"After a waxy opening, the bouquet unveils honey and peach aromas that are totally inviting. It feels thick but not cloying, and the honeyed flavors of banana, peach and dulce de leche are a prelude to the creamy, thick and deeply layered finish. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Albariño make the blend.",D.G. Viticultors NV Caligo Sweet White Wine White (Spain)
6465,"Gorgeously aromatic with notes of freshly pressed apple, wildflower honey and tangerine peel, this is a richly textured, almost creamy, ice wine. Intense flavors of honey and fresh apple ripple on the palate, with striking lemon acidity that lends a squeaky clean finish.",Inniskillin 2008 Ice Wine Riesling (Niagara Peninsula)
6466,"This delivers about the same intensity and concentration as a top shelf Amarone—but for half the price. It offers loads of spice, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and black olive flavors that drive the long, supple mouthfeel.",Le Salette 2009 I Progni  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
6467,"Still tight and chewy, this lushly-fruited Syrah mixes berry and cherry flavors with earthier, mineral-driven bass notes. It will require a bit more bottle age to unwind and decompress, but it has all of the ingredients of a wine with staying power.",Mark Ryan 2009 Wild Eyed Syrah (Red Mountain)
6468,"This is very structured and full, with a powerful minerality, citrus and spice flavors, and a tight, nervy character. It has the weight to age for 3–4 years.",Joseph Drouhin 2010  Chassagne-Montrachet
6469,"This doles out multiple layers of cinnamon, red cherry, vanilla, blackberry, espresso and tobacco flavors. It's modern, chewy and bright, with slightly sweet flavors that would pair with pork and roasted fennel or steak with a creamy mushroom sauce.",Latium di Morini 2008 Campo Leòn  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
6470,"Big and fruity, this is very lively, balancing butteriness with green-fruit acidity. The wine is maturing quickly, its tension is fading into rich, wood-flavored fruitiness.",Louis Latour 2010 Meursault Blagny Premier Cru  (Meursault)
6471,"While it's not for everyone, this is a great expression of Rosenblum-style Rockpile Zin. It's a big, lusty glass of red wine, warm and heady, with extraordinarily ripe berry, currant and mocha flavors.",Rosenblum 2010 Rockpile Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
6472,"Powerful and muscular, this would pair with succulent red meat or piquant cheese. The mouthfeel is velvety and supple, and the bouquet is redolent of cooked berry, prune, dried bay leaf, humus, toasted coffee bean and licorice.",Rubinelli Vajol 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
6473,"This mixes blueberry, boysenberry and blackberry notes with a dressing of Bourbon and chocolate. Smooth and satiny, this is drinking exceptionally well at the moment.",Sleight of Hand 2009 Levitation Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
6474,"A great vintage for the Sundance Red, this is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 14% Syrah. The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits. The 30% new oak is not only lavish for a $20 wine, but it judiciously complements all of the good fruit.",Soos Creek 2009 Sundance Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
6475,"A blend of mainly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other traditional Bordeaux varieties, this treads perilously close to being too ripe. It shows a hint of raisin, but not enough to interfere with the beauty of the blackberry jam and sweet oak flavors. The tannins are exquisite, in the way of a top Napa Cab. Doesn't seem to be a longterm ager, so drink now–2015.",Alpha Omega 2009 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley)
6476,"Using grapes sourced entirely from Boushey Vineyard, this well-structured Syrah has a claret-like refinement. Sleek and focused, it offers raspberry and black cherry flavors, with a tight, taut structure and length. Some notes of leaf and earth trickle onto the finish.",Avennia 2010 Arnaut Syrah (Yakima Valley)
6477,"The minerality is a reminder that the grapes come from an area near Chablis. It has a tangy, zingy character, with a nervy edge that promises aging, but it also provides fruity, apple-driven pleasure now.",Bailly-Lapierre 2007 Vive-la-Joie Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne)
6478,"Dark and brawny, this opens with almost impenetrable concentration and bold aromas of jammy fruit, blackberry, espresso, cedar and moist tobacco. It has a smooth, rich texture, with lively highlights of teriyaki, ginger and cola.",Brunelli 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
6479,"From the prestigious Rutherford appellation comes this soft, smooth and mellow Cabernet, with delicious flavors of black cherry, cola and beef teriyaki. It shows just a trace of bitterness on the finish, so drink soon.",Del Bondio 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
6480,"This is a soft, bland wine, with light fruit flavors, a creamy texture and a final tang of lemon zest. Drink now.",Parras Wines 2014 Terra Grande Branco White (Alentejano)
6481,"This wine has too much wood, with high toast and spice. The fruit is dominated by this wood that is not likely to soften.",Lavradores de Feitoria 2014 Meruge Red (Douro)
6482,"Aromas of oak and orange peel include a strong whiff of clove. This is creamy and resiny in feel, while oaky flavors—clove in particular—sit on top of red-fruit notes. Dry barrel-related flavors are hot on the finish.",Altocedro 2015 Año Cero Pinot Noir (La Consulta)
6483,"A cuvée of Riesling, with a tiny splash of Moscato, this is on the sweet side of brut. Scents of wet paper carry into disjointed flavors of waxy lemon and simple sugar.",Wetzel Estate NV Cuvée Blanc Sparkling (Willamette Valley)
6484,"This extremely simple red has aromas recalling dark-skinned fruit and leather. The lean diluted palate shows suggestions of sour cherry, dried plum and a hint of dark spice alongside fleeting tannins.",Montefrasco 2015 Montefresco  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
6485,"A gluey aroma follows through, cloaking simple, sour flavors of lemon tea in its wake. There is an off flavor in the finish that doesn't subside.",Château Bianca 2015 Riesling (Willamette Valley)
6486,This wine has a geranium aroma and a strangely perfumed character. It is light and fruity although not likely to develop much.,Quinta do Romeu 2011 Red (Douro)
6487,"This wine of unknown grape varieties shows a thread of sweet cola and vanilla throughout a larger tunnel of smoky char, remaining somewhat flat, bitter and simple on the palate.",Sonoma Collection 2014 District 3 Red (Sonoma County)
6488,"Charred, malty, foxy, herbal aromas sound the alarm. This Garnacha-Carignan blend is rough as sandpaper, with heavily oaked flavors of herbaceous black fruits. A rough and rugged finish is abrasive.",Zerran 2014 Red (Montsant)
6489,"This dull, tired wine is quickly moving past drinkability. Flat and lifeless, it hints at leather and little else.",Wetzel Estate 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
6490,"Syrupy and with a distinct taste of raisins, this 100% varietal wine is overdone in terms of ripeness, with a lack of structure. The highlight is its tight hold on black pepper.",Meeker 2012 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
6491,"Chunky pithy stone-fruit and citrus aromas are sketchy, while the palate is tangy and none too pleasant. Flavors of mealy citrus fruits and a finish with the consistency of orange juice do nothing to help this along.",Altos de Cristimil 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
6492,"Wiry and volatile aromas of vinegar and saucy berry fruits fail to impress. This Monastrell-Tempranillo blend is hard and tannic, with murky berry flavors that are also a bit weedy. Heat and a lack of ripeness mar the finish.",Marques Escriba 2013 Monastrell-Tempranillo Red (Jumilla)
6493,"Berry and lemon-peel aromas come with a note of plastic. This feels narrow and acidic, and thus scraping. Tart plum and spice flavors lead to an herbal high-acid palate that leaves a sour lasting impression.",Casa Montes 2014 Ampakama Cabernet Sauvignon (San Juan)
6494,"It's not possible to analyze vineyard practices from afar, but this wine is thin, tart and astringent, suggesting such possibilities as over-cropping, picking too early, or simply the wrong clones. In any event, it's a flavorless wine with no varietal character.",Del Rio 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)
6495,"The aromas show notes of game, vanilla and grape Jolly Rancher, with the volatiles amped up. The flavors bring a mixture of sweet and tart, tussling through the finish.",Oak Knoll NV Toasted Cow 5th Edition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
6496,"Dusty apple aromas set up a foamy palate with no depth or structure. This tastes of bready apple and pear in front of a bland, yeasty finish that nose dives at the count of three.",Bodegas Lozano NV Ophicus Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Spain)
6497,"Aromas of game, cured meat, mature violet and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose. It's extremely simple and diluted, with fleeting tannins and brisk acidity. Tried two bottles, same notes.",Il Chiosso 2008  Ghemme
6498,"The 2013 vintage may not have been good in Spain, but this is really struggling. Green aromas are sharp and suggest vinegar. This feels hard as a pile of rocks, with herbal flavors of green tomato and rustic plum. An herbal-tasting astringent finish will win no new friends.",Marqués de Vargas 2013 Conde de San Cristóbal  (Ribera del Duero)
6499,"Diluted and lean, this opens with aromas recalling wet soil and cut flowers past their prime. The thin über-simple palate isn't very expressive, showing mere suggestions of dried sour cherry and an earthy note.",Pigro 2014  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
6500,"Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are probing and raw. This feels acidic to the point of cutting. Sour, salty, herbal red-fruit flavors are gritty and rough on the finish. This is Salta Cabernet in its most raw, least appealing form.",Quara 2015 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Cafayate)
6501,"This wine is woody, showing concentrated toast and vanilla flavors. It seems to be missing its fruit.",Roncão 2012 Quinta da Levandeira Reserva Red (Douro)
6502,"This dilute red wine could be anything. It's green, tannic, and generic.",Del Rio 2013 Syrah (Rogue Valley)
6503,This wine is perfumed with geranium aromas and rhubarb flavors. It is strange and not likely to improve.,Quinta do Romeu 2012 Reserva Red (Douro)
6504,"Earthy aromas of animal and stewed black fruits set up a hot palate with oaky mint and clove flavors. This is gripping and warm on the finish, with an excess of oak and hard tannins.",Haarth 2013 Made With Organic Grapes Bonarda (Argentina)
6505,"This brut sparkler is out there on the nose, as earthy, not-too-fresh aromas of peanuts and compost set up a coarse palate. Nutty stale citrus flavors end in sour fashion, with a hint of mustard.",Hacienda del Carche NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)
6506,"Light in color, sketchy on the nose and dilute on the palate, all of which means this has discernible issues. Bland flavors suggest grape skins, while this is flat, wheaty and yeasty tasting on the finish.",Trencalòs 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
6507,"Hot rubbery untamed aromas need help. This Syrah-led blend feels clampy and rough. Salty murky black-fruit flavors are herbal and wild, and there's no help coming on the finish, which is grabby.",Josep Grau Viticultor 2015 L'Efecte Volador Red (Montsant)
6508,"The intent here seems to be a low-alcohol “pure” expression of Bonarda. But with volatile high-toned cherry and raspberry aromas along with a narrow scouring palate, this comes across as tart and lean. Sour herbal red-plum flavors are raw on the finish.",Via Revolucionaria 2015 Pura Bonarda (Mendoza)
6509,"Oxidized apricot aromas comprise the bulk of the nose on this weird oak-aged Albariño. Flavors of apricot, peach pit and quince quickly turn bitter, while the finish is flabby. Overall this is sketchy, with few attributes.",Altos de Torona 2013 Barrica Albariño (Rías Baixas)
6510,"Open and simple, this has a light touch of citrus fruit, with an edge of wood in the background. It is bright and ready to drink.",Domaine Patrick Javillier 2010 Cuvée Oligocene  (Bourgogne)
6511,"There's virtually no bouquet to this wine, and the palate follows suit with a flat feel and hollow, faded flavors of balsamic-doused cherry and herb. It seems aged and dried out.",Finca Vieja 2004 Reserva Tempranillo (La Mancha)
6512,"This Cabernet was made to be consumed as a dessert wine. It's soft, simple and very sweet, with white sugar and cherry jam flavors.",Jeunesse 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
6513,"Fruity, ripe and round, this is simple Chardonnay that gives pleasure from its warm texture and softness. The apple flavor leads to a gentle finish.",Lupé-Cholet 2010  Bourgogne
6514,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot, this feels a little light on flesh, providing little cushion to the high acids. A campfire smokiness underscores the rusty dark-fruit note, which ultimately finishes a bit short.",2 Lads 2009 Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Old Mission Peninsula)
6515,"A hit of sulfur slowly blows off to reveal aromas of hot stone and maple syrup, with undertones of dark stone fruit and dill. The medium-bodied palate offers soft acids that lend a slightly flat feel, with mild tannins adding some support.",Brys 2010 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Old Mission Peninsula)
6516,"Hints of chalk dust and savory stem and leaf notes detract from the bright peach, grapefruit and flower notes on both the nose and palate. Dry in style, but its a shade sugary on the attack.",Silver Thread 2011 Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes)
6517,"Notes of spiced toast, Raisinets, hickory and prune mingle on the smoky, slightly baked nose. The flavors are concentrated and intense, but the baked quality is a little too distracting.",Mount Pleasant Winery 2007 Bethlehem Valley Norton (Missouri)
6518,"A dirty nose spoils this otherwise attractive, easy, crisp Chablis. The palate has some notes of yeast and bright white fruit, with a citrusy finish.",Domaine L. Chatelain 2011  Chablis
6519,"This is a lean, acid-driven wine, without much in the way of generous fruit. It has a green strawberry note, with a light sense of structure and a minerally finish.",L. Tramier & Fils 2010 La Minée  (Bourgogne)
6520,"This is a gentle wine that's textured with acidity, offering yellow and white fruits and some toast and spice flavors. It is round and soft, finishing with a tight edge of acidity.",Louis Jadot 2010  Bourgogne
6521,"Surprisingly light for the vintage, this has a wood note and intense acidity, with a crisp, almost green, raspberry flavor. The finish is juicy.",André Guichot 2009  Bourgogne
6522,"The spiced dark-cherry and blackberry aromas come with a rusty edge, leading to a palate that's marked by vivid acids and trifling tannic support. In general, this is lithe and easy, a wine that would pair well with pizza.",Vivác Winery 2009 Montepulciano (New Mexico)
6523,"Stewy yet flush, with shearing acids, this has a meaty, leafy aroma that sets up the angular palate. Flavors of stewed berry, spiced tomato and burnt leaves turn slightly bitter on what amounts to a short finish.",Gladium 2009 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha)
6524,"Flavors of berry preserves and toast are loosely concentrated, with peppy acids that charge the palate. It finishes rather short on flavor; the tannic grip is the lasting element.",Mount Pleasant Winery NV Dry Norton (Missouri)
6525,"This has a prevailing fortified-wine scent to its nose, with details of plum liqueur and mint-chocolate. It's muscular and overtly firm on the palate; the fortified wine quality creates a slightly discordant sensation.",Mount Pleasant Winery NV Estates Cabernet Sauvignon (America)
6526,"Smelling grapey on the nose, this has additional notes of white currant, toast and white stone fruit. It starts soft, with flavors that are rather low in concentration. The medium-bodied mouthfeel turns zesty as the wine advances across the palate, finishing with touches of honeyed toast and apple.",Three Fox 2010 La Boheme Viognier (Virginia)
6527,"The acidity is the prominent attribute of this wine, jutting out with little flesh to buffer its cut. Light, dusty tannins add some traction to the palate, with a leafy herb note surfacing on the short finish.",Truro 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Southeastern New England)
6528,"This has a reedy red-berry aroma and a citrus note. Confirmation of the bouquet comes on the palate, which is lean and scouring, with red plum, pomegranate and herb flavors. The finish is cleansing, but it doesn't show much substance.",Santa Quiteria 2010 Altitud 1.100 Garnacha Tintorera Alicante Bouschet (Almansa)
6529,"A jammy raspberry aroma comes with milk chocolate and plastic scents. It feels pulpy yet spunky, with red plum and strawberry flavors. The mild finish doesn't evolve or expand, but it registers as being fresh.",Bodegas Navarro López 2009 Old Vines Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
6530,"This smells like a melted Luden's cough drop sprinkled with coffee grounds and spices. Medium bodied, it has a jumbled herbal flavor, finishing with warmth and notes of dark chocolate and coffee.",Vivác Winery 2009 Tempranillo (New Mexico)
6531,"This Cabernet has blackberry and dried herb flavors, with sizable tannins and pretty hefty acidity.",Wine Spots 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

6533,"There's a raw cut of acidity that gives this simple wine a sour taste. On the plus side, it's nice and dry, with some cherry fruit. For the price, it's a helpful introduction to the charms of Pinot Noir.",Lost Angel 2011 Pinot Noir (California)
6534,"This blend of 75% Pinot Grigio and 15% Vermentino is a light, simple quaff with some snap to it and not much on the finish.",Peltier 2011 Hybrid Pinot Grigio (Lodi)

6536,"Light and simple, this is all about fruit and freshness. There is a hint of citrus, and the acidity shows well on the finish. More of an aperitif style.",Pierre André 2010 Octavie Crémieux  (Bourgogne)
6537,"This is a combination of tropical fruits and tight acidity, making for an unbalanced wine that seems not to know its way.",Domaine Verret et Fils 2010  Chablis
6538,"This is very soft and lacking in definition, with a light texture. However, it does have a crisp apple flavor and a line of acidity that gives freshness.",Georges Duboeuf 2011  Mâcon-Villages
6539,"Chewy tannins and tart acids buttress the midpalate's broad berry flavor. The fruit seems to thin out on the finish, concluding with more bone and muscle than succulent flesh. Pairing this with a rare burger would help tame the structural components.",Debonné 2009 Cabernet Franc (Grand River Valley)
6540,"Generous floral and honeylike aromas lead to flavors of Fuji apples and Anjou pears with a rounded, fairly crisp texture. This wine is not typical for the varietal, but is tasty and enjoyable.",Middle Sister NV Surfer Chick Sauvignon Blanc (California)

6553,"Earthy, scratchy berry, plum and spice aromas are inviting on the nose. This is bold, acidic and a touch sharp in feel, with generic black-fruit flavors as well as toasty oak and spice. A fresh finish with leftover notes of blackberry winds things down.",Viña La Fortuna 2013 Ventura Reserve Malbec (Lontué Valley)
6554,"This Malbec opens with a blast of raw woodgrain, a lactic smell, leather and finally some black fruit. The palate is racy and potent, with resiny oak leading herbal berry flavors. A fiery, hot finish brings this to a scouring close.",Vistamar 2013 Sepia Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley)

6558,A pink-meets-tan color is the greeting on this peachy Pinot Grigio that smells like fresh applesauce. A spunky palate of stone fruit and moderate acidity deals additional notes of waxy melon.,Sierra Batuco 2015 Reserva Pinot Grigio (Maule Valley)
6559,"Fresh, leafy herbs and lemon zest perfume this slightly grapey, somewhat “foxy” if you will, wine. It's crisp and cutting in mouthfeel, finishing on a juicy white grapefruit note.",Adirondack Winery 2013 Summit Solitude Seyval Blanc (New York)

6564,"Yeasty aromas lead to a mild palate with a modest bubble bead. In fact, this is so smooth and low on edge that it comes across more like a still rosé than sparkling rosé. Flavors of peach and nectarine finish round, pithy and yeasty.",Indomita NV Rosé Sparkling (Casablanca Valley)
6565,"Aromas of freshly laid asphalt and char-grilled hamburger shroud herbal berry aromas. This Tannat is chunky on the palate, but low on structure.

6568,"Bell pepper and citrus aromas are limited in scope. The palate feels acidic, with quick-hitting flavors of green herbs, bell pepper and tropical fruits. Pyrazine-based flavors of bell pepper and bitter herbs push the finish.",Millaman 2014 Estate Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley)
6569,"This is powerful, typical of Les Preuses. White and yellow fruits are important to the palate, but so are rich, honeyed toast, minerality and an opulent, intense concentration. This is impressive, elegance with power, and worth aging for several years.",La Chablisienne 2006 Les Preuses Grand Cru  (Chablis)
6570,"Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute. Expensive, but all the proceeds are for charity.",Lookout Ridge 2006 Greg La Follette Van de Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain)
6571,"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.",Olivier Leflaive 2006  Corton-Charlemagne
6572,"Sumptuous and rich, a fully gorgeous Chardonnay, with butter and citrus flavors combining with panache. The wine just fill the mouth, a succession of pineapple, soft toast, spice and mango flavors, finished with acidity. To drink now, but it is worth keeping for 2–3 years.",Xavier Monnot 2006 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault)
6573,"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.",Domaine Leflaive 2006 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
6574,"Bold and forward, this estate-grown Syrah fairly explodes with scents of game, cured meat and smoke. The black cherry and cassis fruit forms a dense and sappy core; as the wine skips across the tongue nuances of tobacco, sweet leather, chocolate and spices come into play. It just keeps on going, adding caramel and peppery chocolate through an evolving and satisfying finish.",Fielding Hills 2006 RiverBend Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope)
6575,"This exuberant Tokaji starts with an enticing nose of orange peel, honey, flowers and toast, and explodes in the mouth with intense, delicious waves of lemon, orange and honey flavors. A perfect balance of acid and fruit keeps the wine fresh without losing its luscious appeal. A memorable wine loaded with personality and excitement.",Royal Tokaji 1999 Mézes Mály Aszú 6 Puttonyos  (Tokaji)
6576,"A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors. Then acidity comes through, a fresh lift that leaves the wine with a clean, smooth finish. And once these initial fruits soften, the secondary flavors promise some good aging. Screwcap.",Domaine Laroche 2006 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis)
6577,"A superb wine. It opens slowly in the mouth, revealing layers of toast followed by intense white and green fruits. Spice and nutmeg accent the kiwi, pepper and pineapple notes, all concentrated around a core of minerality. Age for at least four years.",Domaine Leflaive 2006 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
6578,"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.",Sheridan Vineyard 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
6579,"Made from 100% Cab, this wine pours inky black, and feels softly ripe in the mouth, with pie-filling blackberries, cherries, mocha, plums, tobacco and sweet dusty spices. Shows a tannic astringency that strongly suggests cellaring, although it's flashy now. Best after 2011 and beyond.",Whitehall Lane 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
6580,"This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.",Woodward Canyon 2006 Old Vines Dedication Series #26 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
6581,"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through. Give this high quality wine until the summer of 2009.",Dutton-Goldfield 2006 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
6582,"This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich. The wine layers the white fruits and mandarin orange zest with some judicious toast from the wood, leaving spice and ripe acidity on the finish.",Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Champs Gains Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
6583,"A beautiful Pinot Noir notable for sheer lusciousness, which is partly due to high alcohol. The flavors are remarkably rich and ripe in cherries, currants and cola, with savory hints of mint and cocoa. Displays a great balance of acids, tannins and oak. Great now and for a decade.",Joseph Swan Vineyards 2006 Great Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
6584,"This bottling from Lost Canyon is one of California's best-kept Syrah secrets. Year after year, it's a rich, tannic, dramatically structured wine of impressive depth and deliciousness. Packed with dry berry, cherry, leather, mocha and toasty oak flavors, it's beautiful now, with decanting, and should hold and even improve for up to six years.",Lost Canyon 2007 Trenton Station Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)
6585,"Stillwater and Conner Lee vineyard grapes go into this fresh and spicy Chardonnay, detailed with herb and spice and cucumber flavors. An interesting take on Washington Chardonnay, with unusual complexity and length. The spicy notes extend beautifully; though known primarily as a red wine producer, Mark Ryan has an especially good feel for white wines.",Mark Ryan 2006 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
6586,"A wine that shows the superlative quality of white Burgundy in 2006, this is big, powerful and yet finely restrained. The yellow fruits are tempered with citrus, the weight and full character of the wine balanced with ultra-fresh acidity. Age this wine for 2–3 years.",Olivier Leflaive 2006 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
6587,"Here's one for the cellar. The tannins swamp the mouth, giving a hard, astringent edge. But the wine is beautifully balanced and dry, with a deep core of black currants, blueberries, spicy plums, cedar and minerals. Impressive. Best after 2010.",Roberts & Rogers 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
6588,"Very black and dense, a super-young wine that shows pedigree and promise for development. Impresses for its fine structure of thick tannins and acidity, and the way the lush black currant and chocolate fruit meets the toasty oak. Good now, and should improve for up to four or five years, at least.",Quivet Cellars 2006 Las Madres Vineyard Syrah (Carneros)
6589,"This wine has a rustic but appealing air about it, with its cedary pepper and luscious jam nose and elegant balance of berry, smoke and spice. The wine is approachable and will pair with smoked meats and spicy dishes well.",The Foundry 2004 Syrah (Coastal Region)
6590,"Tight mineral notes shape this wine and created extra dimension over what is a simple, genuine and fruity Chianti Classico. The wine offers chewy cherry, some chocolate notes and spicy acidity on the close.",Villa Cerna 2006  Chianti Classico
6591,"Although this Pinot is a bit thin, it does offer plenty of elegant sophistication. The structure shows off the Sonoma Coast, with vibrant acidity and a clean, dry mouthfeel. The flavors are of cherries with bitter skins, pomegranates, rhubarb, cola and peppery spices. Drink now.",Williams Selyem 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
6592,"The wine opens with sweet aromas of bursting cherry, marzipan, cinnamon, nutmeg and a touch of licorice for extra dimension. It offers some sour cherry in the mouth with spicy tones over a lean, streamlined consistency. Made by enologist Stefano Chioccioli.",Gagliole 2006 Rubiolo  (Chianti Classico)
6593,"A wine that's all about grapefruit and white currant fruits. This is very fresh, very crisp, tightened by minerality, with a lively, juicy lemon finish.",Guilbaud Frères 2007 Le Soleil Nantais  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
6594,"This nice drinking Chard offers plenty of bang for the buck. It's dry and creamy, with oak-infused pear, peach and green apple fruit flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices.",Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 59 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
6595,"This is a smooth and creamy Vernaccia with loads of honey backed by delicate nuances of stone fruit and passion fruit. It leaves a light, crisp impression in the mouth and can be paired with appetizers or pasta dishes.",Casa alle Vacche 2007  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
6596,"This wine delivers notes of forest floor and small berries  backed by clove, green spice, pretty herbal and menthol notes. It's a bit raw and thorny in the mouth but it does offer refreshing crispness and sweet fruit on the finish.",Castello Vicchiomaggio 2006 Montevasco  (Chianti Classico)
6597,"Tastes a bit old and tired for a Zin that's less than 4 years of age, but on the plus side is the light, silky texture and complex flavors of dried berries and red currants, cola, cocoa, anise and black peppercorn.",D'Argenzio 2004 Tom Feeney Ranch Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
6598,"Very fresh, crisp raspberry flavors are layered with acidity. This shows the bright red fruit character of 2007—light, fragrant, maybe finishing with some leanness.",Domaine du Clos du Fief 2007 Cuvée Tradition  (Juliénas)
6599,"An intense, dark-colored wine, flavored with spice, tobacco, hints of mint and dark berry fruits. It's certainly rich, but the tannins do come through along with some green pepper flavors to finish.",Domaine Philippe Delesvaux 2005 La Montée de l'Epine Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou)
6600,"Soft and fruity, showing attractive ripe red cherry fruits along with hints of candy, light acidity and gentle tannins. It's a pleasing wine, easy and ready to drink, one of those Beaujolais that is best slightly chilled.",Georges Duboeuf 2007  Beaujolais-Villages
6601,"This is crystalline Vernaccia with bright aromas of pear, citrus and a touch of white peppercorn or natural rubber. It goes down in a fresh and clean manner and ends with a citrus crispness.",Vagnoni 2007  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
6602,"Oaky and a little spotty, with aromas of cheese, cinnamon and wood resin sitting heavily on herbal, traditional fruit. The acidity is bracing, so there's a lemony bite to the palate along with flavors of raisin, raspberry and cherry. A fairly good blend of Merlot, Carmenère and Cabernet, but one that's missing a few parts.",Valle Frio 2004 Reserva Merlot-Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Maule Valley)
6603,"This is an easy, fruit-forward wine that would pair well with family dinners and simple pasta dishes. Cherry, bramble, wet earth, pressed violets and light coffee tones characterize the nose and are exactly what you should look for in a no-fuss Chianti. Vibrant berry flavors are carried forward thanks to the wine's smooth structure.",Villa Poggio Salvi 2006 Caspagnolo  (Chianti Colli Senesi)
6604,"Pale in color and tart in acidity, this Pinot is a bit on the thin side, fruit-wise. It offers a blast of Asian spices and mint, with suggestions of cherries, citrus zest and Dr. Pepper. Drink this dry, elegant wine now.",Williams Selyem 2006 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
6605,"Light peach aromas mix with a hint of sea breeze to give this wine a subtle approach. The palate is more alive, with mild citrus and lemon-lime flavors. Almost seems like a refreshing sip of lemonade by the time it fades away.",La Playa 2007 Block Selection Limari Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley)
6606,"Luminous and bright, this beautiful Vernaccia offers pretty tones of honey, peach, pear and cherry blossoms. There's a sweet element to the nose that creates an interesting contrast with the wine's natural acidity.",Le Solive 2007 Vigna Aprico  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
6607,"On the leaner side, with mineral overtones to the grapefruit and cut-grass aromas and flavors. Comes out of the bottle with some smelly reductive notes that take some aeration to eliminate, so decant before serving.",Mount Nelson 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
6608,"A crisp, delicious wine, with all the right fresh acidity, tensely green fruits and very refreshing lightness. The wine will sit delicately and satisfyingly alongside any fish dish.",Remy-Pannier 2007  Muscadet Sèvre et Maine

6610,"Robertson has managed to create a solid, appealing Chardonnay at an excellent price. This one has a big nose of fresh fruit and orange citrus, and on the palate, assertive fruit and toast. Not terribly complex but definitely robust and flavorful, this is an ideal everyday white.",Robertson Winery 2007 Chardonnay (Robertson)
6611,"Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin.",Sbragia 2006 Home Ranch Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley)
6612,"Shows those classic, old-fashioned Howell Mountain tannins that lock the wine down and make it more or less undrinkable in youth. There are some good black currant flavors, but they're not really powerful, and have herbal notes alongside. That makes the future of this wine a question.",Serdonis 2004 Ink Grade Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
6613,"Pungent grassy aromas vie with passion fruit on the nose, while the flavors lean more toward the tropical fruit side of things. This is a medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc that plays it safe, offering a comfortable drink at a reasonable price.",Seven Terraces 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
6614,"This overall good, refreshing Chard is a go-to white for everyday sipping. On the nose, citrus, apples, and fresh Chardonnay fruit leads, and on the palate, straightforward fruit is both elegant and approachable. The finish is substantial. Pair with poultry, seafood, or sip alone.",Shark Trust 2007 Great White Unwooded Chardonnay (Western Cape)
6615,Here's a fresh and feminine expression of Pinot Nero with nuances of wild berry and white cherry followed by light touches of spice and almond skin. Balanced acidity and a lively finish make the wine very enjoyable indeed.,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2010 Pinot Nero (Alto Adige)
6616,"A brisk, sturdy Cabernet, marked by firm tannins, tart acidity and a marked coating of sweet, smoky oak. It's Janzen's basic Napa Cabernet, and shows the winery's ability to produce elegant Cabs. But it's not an ager.",Janzen 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
6617,"A rich and fruity wine with dense cherry and strawberry fruits and a dry, tannic structure. It has a tough edge that suggests aging potential while also bringing out a ripe character from this southernmost appellation in the Côte d'Or.",Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2010 Clos Roussots Premier Cru  (Maranges)
6618,"K-J's basic Cab has gotten pricier over the years, but quality has kept up. This wine still offers excellent value.

6619,"All from Windrige Vineyard, this is an aromatic, appealing dessert-style wine with notes of dried pink grapefruit and honey. At 18.6% residual sugar, it's rich and concentrated, with good depth and intensity.",Koenig Vineyards 2010 Ice Wine Riesling
6620,"This feminine Prosecco Superiore offers bright floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle followed by peach and melon. The style is extra dry, meaning there is a veil of sweetness at the back, that is enhanced by the soft sparkling foam. This wine is truly enjoyable.",La Tordera NV Serrai Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
6621,"A lovely rosé, dry and crisp, with peach skin, orange, strawberry and white pepper flavors, highlighted by brisk acidity. Would score higher if not for a certain heaviness.",Le P'tit Paysan 2011 Pierre's Pirouette Rosé of Mourvèdre (San Benito County)
6622,This blend of Antão Vaz and Verdelho is rich and creamy with spice and green plum flavors given a boost by vanilla and ginger flavors. There's a fine perfumed aftertaste from the Verdelho.,Luis Duarte 2012 Rapariga da Quinta Branco White (Alentejano)

6626,"There's a dark and austere quality to this Chianti Classico riserva that gives it a very masculine personality. When aged, Sangiovese tends to deliver aromas of candied fruit, cassis, tar and licorice, and this wine does just that.",Querciavalle 2007 Losi Millennium Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
6627,"The aromas are light for a Viognier, with notes of flowers, herbs and peach. Still, it brings a lot of appeal, with broad fruit flavors accented by residual sugar (0.4%), showing a bit of heat on the finish.",Season 2012 Viognier (Southern Oregon)

6634,"This extremely dark-colored Malbec offers mellow blueberry and blackberry aromas. The palate is big, jammy feeling and features only pokes of acidic cut.

Drink now through 2016.",TintoNegro 2010 Finca la Escuela Estate Grown Altamira Malbec (Mendoza)
6635,"Jammy aromas of baked blackberry and plum are fiery at first and then flatten out with airing. A choppy palate offers a bumpy ride with ripe plum and berry flavors in front of a full-force, toasty finish that shows a strong grip courtesy of big tannins. This is two-thirds Garnacha with Syrah and Carignan.",Altavins 2009 Tempus Red (Terra Alta)

6637,"A light, lemony and crisp Chardonnay with a long, lemony finish begging for fresh seafood and spice—think fish tacos—Husch's Vine One has a hint of just-ripe pear layered in, too. Refreshing and aromatic, this is an all-around great value that'll pair well with a wide range of foods.",Husch 2011 Vine One Chardonnay (Anderson Valley)

6639,"While this is fiery on the nose, you also get attractive, complex aromas of baked cherry, brandied plum, leather, coffee and chocolate.

6645,"A candied element of butterscotch, caramel and dried apricot opens the nose of this luminous and bright Chardonnay.

Drink from 2017.",Herdade das Servas 2011 Reserva Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano)
6941,"Petrol and citrus aromas and flavors merge seamlessly in this medium-bodied dry Riesling.

6942,"This is a structured, balanced white with aromas of gooseberry, flint and spice on the nose, and flavors of fresh citrus and fruit on the palate.

Picks up hints of orange and clove on the finish, with a suggestion of citrus pith.",Pfeffingen 2007 Dry Riesling (Pfalz)
6947,"Fans of this sometimes kinky grape variety will probably feel this rating is too low. This wine starts of with hints of Scheurebe's wild side, offering up hints of something resembling Sauvignon Blanc, then adding almost tropical fruit and currant and pink grapefruit flavors tinged with just enough residual sugar for balance. A wild ride, but an enjoyable one.",Pfeffingen 2007 Ungsteiner Herrenberg Spätlese Scheurebe (Pfalz)
6948,"Coffee, cigarbox and mocha aromas and flavors characterize this Rietvallei red. Complex and assertive, the wine unfolds with a chewy but poised intensity. The lingering finish has a tobacco-like touch. Pair with smoked meats, rich stews.",Rietvallei Estate Wine 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson)
6949,"Fragrant, smoky, oaky and seductive, this toasty wine is immediately appealing, and has been given the all-star treatment. The young vineyard offers promising fruit; its flavors light and clean, tasting of raspberries and pie cherries. Lots of oak gives it a very chocolaty finish.",Robert Karl 2005 Gunselman Bench Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
6950,"We've noticed traces of volatility in past Sesti Brunellos, but the 2004 vintage smells polished and pristine. Aromas of black fruit, spice and cured meat are intact, generous and are delivered with uplifting force and buoyancy. This helps contribute to the general intensity of the wine and the supple nature of its mouthfeel.",Sesti 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
6951,"Podere Paganico offers an impressive level of aromatic complexity thanks to layers of forest floor, dried apricot, underbrush, wet earth, cured meats and dried apple skins. It's a chewy, big wine with solid texture and firm tannins.",Podere Paganico 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
6952,"At first, this Riesling looks sort of bland and troubled—the aromas are nondescript, the mouthfeel broad. But this wine really improves given time—the melon and peach fruit comes alive and crisp, citrusy notes assert themselves on the finish.",J.L. Wolf 2006 Wachenheimer Belz Spätlese Riesling (Pfalz)
6953,"More yellow than Lustau's manzanilla, Jarana is a lovely, proper fino with a nose of iodine, lemon blossom and popcorn. The palate is staunch and doesn't back down; the high-toned nut and citrus flavors seem classic and elevated. And the finish is intense and frames everything in walnut oil and toast.",Lustau NV Light Fino Jarana Sherry (Jerez)
6954,"Young and fresh, this 100% Malbec has tight, spicy, peppery fruit that leads into a surprisingly long finish. It's not tricked up with oak, but the sharp young berry flavors evolve in the mouth and bring on clove, wintergreen and mint, which resonate through a lingering finish. Though the fruit lacks flesh, it doesn't hold back on pure flavor, and promises good things ahead for this new vineyard.",:Nota Bene 2006 Verhey Vineyard Malbec (Yakima Valley)
6955,"This is a somewhat soft and friendly wine, filled with ripe peaches and pears, and with a backbone of lime-like citrus. It even boasts a subtle dose of minerality. Yet it lacks the power and precision of some of the other Rebholz wines, instead settling for being soft and cuddly rather than profound.",Ökonomierat Rebholz 2007 Von Rotliegenden Spätlese Riesling (Pfalz)
6956,"This “great growth” is richly concentrated, even a bit syrupy in texture, although almost totally dry in style. Pear, peach and pineapple aromas and flavors give the impression of fruit nectar, then pick up enough salty minerality on the finish to add interest and provide balance.",Fitz-Ritter 2006 Dürkheimer Michelsberg Grosses Gewächs Riesling (Pfalz)
6957,Ripe peaches are glazed with honey and dusted with crushed stone in this sweet wine that's lush and honeyed yet manages to retain some measure of restraint. A hint of citrus pith on the finish provides balance.,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan 2006 Deidesheimer Leinhöhle Spätlese Riesling (Pfalz)
6958,"Dark colored wine, with ripe black plum flavors that lie over solidly textured tannins. Structured to bring out the fruit, the wine also has a core of wood, spice, dark cocoa and black currant acidity to finish. An attractive wine that is worth aging for another two years.",Château Franc-Cardinal 2005  Bordeaux Côtes de Francs 
6959,"A new wood aged selection of vines from Château Haut Beyzac, a property being restored by Pennsylvanian Daren Miller and his French in-laws.

6961,"This blend is dominated by one of the two grapes of Vinho Verde: the Loureiro. That gives both a crisp texture and ripe apple and green-plum fruits. It is a ripe wine, juicy and ready to drink now.",Quinta de Paços 2016 White (Vinho Verde)
6962,"This six-year-old blend of 46% Syrah, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot is showing its age, with aromas of reduced cherry sauce, tar and cocoa dust. The rustic palate is full of leather, tobacco, dried cherries and dusty earth flavors. Still interesting, but drink up soon.",Reyes 2011 Robby's Red (California)
6963,"Aromas of black plum, vanilla and a whiff underbrush lead the nose. Made with 80% Corvina, 10% Corvinone and 10% Rondinella, the light-bodied palate shows blackberry jam, clove and a hint of cocoa alongside loose-knit tannins. Drink soon.",Santi 2015 Ventale  (Valpolicella Superiore)

6966,"The nose is rather shy but eventually shows earthy aromas of grilled herb, charcuterie and ground clove. The aromas follow over to the juicy, rather rustic palate along with red cherry and a funky hint of game. It's easy drinking, with loose, somewhat fleeting tannins.",Tenuta Casaletti 2016  Valpolicella
6967,"This is a rounded mouth-filling wine that takes mild watermelon aromas and adds subtle white peach and pear flavors. It's quite rich in texture, low in acidity and alcohol, and has a lingering finish.",Uphill Vineyards 2016 Estate Grown Rosato di Primitivo (Amador County)
6968,"This Cabernet Franc has pronounced aromas of red and black cherries, violets, lavender, licorice and juniper berries. Tart berries and toasty oak show on the palate, yet mild tannins offer little structure. The finish is long and tart.",Veramar 2016 JB Winemaker Series Cabernet Franc (Shenandoah Valley)
6969,"Tarry grit and char are the lead aromas on this Tannat that contains 15% Ruby Cabernet, which is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan.

6972,"This ripe wine is full of apple and pear fruit with a touch of citrus. It is full, the acidity just pointing up the richness. There are almond flavors as well as spice from the wood aging. Drink from 2018.",Adega Vila Real 2016 Premium White (Douro)
6973,"Lean, racy aromas of green fruits and cactus pad announce a pinched, zingy, high-acid palate. Briny, lightly green citrus flavors finish tight and chalky, with raw acidity that you can feel on your teeth and gums.",Agustinos 2016 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Bío Bío Valley)
6974,"Tart, firm and simple, this wine lacks complexity and structure somewhat, providing quiet flavors of leather saddle and cedar amongst a soft rounded tannin profile.",Arbor Bench Vineyards 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
6975,"While the familiar white version of this wine is from Vinho Verde, the producers have gone a little further south to the Douro for the red. That gives a soft wine but with weight and attractive layers of red-berry fruits and a touch of warmth. Drink now.",Aveleda 2015 Casal Garcia Red (Douro)
6976,"Apple, melon and a touch of vanilla give a tasty spectrum of aromas and flavors to this medium-bodied wine. It's light enough to sip easily but has a bit of depth to the flavors that makes it interesting.",Belle Ambiance 2016 Pinot Grigio (California)

6980,"This wine is dry and likely to remain so. That's because the black currant flavors are too light for the structure, resulting in high acidity, firm tannins and a hole in the middle.",Château Larrivaux 2013  Haut-Médoc
6981,"Charred oak aromas settle on creamy, with a note of plastic to go with heavy spice and secondary berry scents. This feels raw, tannic and grabby. Flavors of plum and clove are woody, while this has the texture of grape-skin extract on the finish, meaning it's rough and grabby.",Chilensis 2015 Reserva Estate Bottled Malbec (Maule Valley)
6982,"On the riper spectrum rather than youthful and fresh, this shows wet wool, ripe lemons and stone fruit, with a hint of green beans and florals. The palate is backed by searing acidity and a slightly woolly texture. Rather simple in style but it clearly shows the characters of both the Sauvignon Blanc and the Sémillon.",Clairault 2016 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)
6983,"Dark-skinned berry and ground clove aromas lift out of the glass. Reflecting the nose, the no-frills, enjoyable palate offers Marasca cherry and a black-pepper note alongside easygoing tannins. It's simple but well made.",Delibori 2016  Bardolino Classico

6991,"Cigar box and very ripe strawberry dominate the aromatic profile, though a bit of bell pepper lingers in the background.

6992,"This blend of Merlot and Tempranillo, with touches of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, opens with notes of warm cherry pie, black tobacco and cedar. Fresh boysenberry starts the palate, with mouthwatering spice in the midpalate and mocha on the finish.",Haka by Labyrinth 2010 Freebird Red (Paso Robles)
6993,"A Syrah-esque bit of smoke and cured meat wafts from this wine aromatically, which follows through on the palate.

6996,"This bold, dry, firmly tannic wine will taste good now with rich foods, but could easily improve with aging through 2017.

7003,"This is full of superripe red fruits, full-bodied and concentrated. It offers spice as well as fruitiness, both well integrated and given a lift by the attractive lemon acidity. It's a rosé for winter and could match turkey with its weight and density.",Château la Coste 2013 Bellugue Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
7004,"Firm and solidly structured, this is a dense wine. It has plenty of tannins and a touch of bitter chocolate, but they are supported by the ripe fruit and fresh black currant flavors. It's a wine for aging, drink from 2017.",Château Lagrave 2012 Le Second  (Saint-Émilion)
7005,"From a Merlot-dominated, 24-acre vineyard this is a strongly mineral wine, with young, dark tannins and a powerful structure. A more juicy, fruity side brings out black currants and berries. Together the structure and the fruit promise good aging. Drink from 2017.",Château le Moulin d'Ulysse 2011  Haut-Médoc

7014,"One of a pair of wines from Palayson blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. This, with its 80% Syrah and 20% Cabernet, is perfumed and spicy. With great violet aromas and firm spice and tannin, it does show power and alcohol. At the same time, it has the potential to round out into a smooth and full-bodied wine. Drink from 2017.",Château de Palayson 2009 Grande Cuvée Cabernet-Syrah (Var)
7015,"Here's a solid wine full of both tannins and dark fruits. New oak barrels give a spicy character while supporting the fruitiness.

Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",Château des Matards 2012 Cuvée Nathan  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)

7021,"Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2007 Wintzheim Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
7022,"Hobo's Zins are almost always among the most balanced and elegant out there, while preserving the variety's spicy, briary personality.

7025,"My favorite of Grant Taylor's 2008s, the Bannockburn bottling displays elegant lacings of vanilla and cinnamon over black cherries, then adds subtle meaty and herbal nuances. It's medium bodied and supple in texture, with a long, silky finish. Drink now–2015.",Valli 2008 Bannockburn Vineyard Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
7026,"A lovely wine that makes the case for bottling Cab Franc on its own. Shows beautifully ripe, fine Napa tannins with complex flavors of red cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and cedar. Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.",William Harrison 2006 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Rutherford)
7027,"At the age of four-plus years, this Cab still tastes young and fresh, as though it were bottled yesterday.

Not quite ready for prime time, so give it 3–5 years to mellow.",Brion 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
7028,"The bulkiness that characterized earlier vintages of this Merlot-based blend has been tamed in this vintage, and the 2007 is a remarkably harmonious, elegant blend of ripe cherries, dried spices, chocolate and cedar.

7029,"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm. It's a fat, fleshy wine, with luscious black cherry tart, cola and caramelized oak flavors. Fine now, and should develop for 5–7 years.",Peju 2006 Reserve Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Rutherford)
7030,"Harrison's Cabernet is a bit hard in youth, marked by strong tannins that make for an astringent mouthfeel. It's also somewhat linear in varietal flavor, with ripe black currants and blackberries and a certain minerality. Not drinkable now, but all indications are for a good future. Better after 2012.",William Harrison 2006 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
7031,"A big, bold and beautiful Cabernet. Will appeal to those who like the California style, although Bordeauxphiles will find it too ripe and fruity. Brims with blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and sweet toasted oak, wrapped into firm, mountain tannins. Now–2014.",Barnett 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
7032,"There are impressive aromas here of stone and passion fruits, dried herbs and thick, nutty overtones at the back.

This is a wine you excavate as much as drink; it's full of surprises.",Brittan Vineyards 2006 Basalt Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
7034,"This is powerful, a fine expression of the richness of 2005. Dense and dusty tannins fit in the structure of ripe, black plums and currants. It has just the right amount of acidity to keep fresh among all this richness.",Château Coutet 2005  Saint-Émilion
7035,"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy.

Drink now through 2014.",Teso La Monja 2007 Almirez  (Toro)
7036,"Lifted cherry and floral aromatics carry with them a hint of barrel char in this medium-bodied, elegantly styled blend of 51% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot, 11% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec. It's admirably supple and harmonious from start to finish. Drink now–2015.",Trinity Hill 2007 The Gimblett Red (Hawke's Bay)
7037,"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like.

Give it until 2011 to mellow.",Kendall-Jackson 2007 Highlands Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley)
7038,"New oak dominates this young wine, with vanilla-accented buttered toast and smoky aromas.

7047,"Earthy stalky leathery aromas suggest modest ripeness. This feels medium in weight, while short salty flavors of plum and raspberry are herbal and arguably a touch weedy. This feels a little hot on the finish.",Septima 2014 Malbec (Mendoza)
7048,This wine is somewhat diluted and one-dimensional. It makes a straightforward attempt at bringing a richness of apple and anise to the fore around neutral oak dynamics before finishing ripe and full.,Mossback 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
7049,"A sweet rosé that is light and fresh from the crisp raspberry acidity. It is bright and fruity, ready to drink.",Quintas de Melgaço 2014 Lagar Rosé (Vinho Verde)
7050,"Fleshy, unfocused aromas of apple and peach are a touch oxidized. This Chardonnay feels bland. Flavors of melon and peach lack tension and character, while there's not much flavor to the finish other than mild apple and some bitterness.",Bodegas San Valero 2014 Particular Chardonnay (Cariñena)
7051,"Reduced in a weight of oak and tight tannins, this wine takes time to come around and develop any juiciness to the palate, offering a mix of red cherry and cranberry laced in forest and spice. It finishes quick and lean.",Halleck 2013 Three Sons Cuvee Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
7052,"Somewhat disjointed, this watery effort hints at berry flavors, with a bit of road tar and cola.",Henry Estate 2014 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
7053,"Grassy, herbal aromas rest on top of basic red-fruit notes. This feels choppy and hollow, with flavors of buttery oak, chemical and red currant. The raw hot finish doesn't have a lot of body or padding.",Luis Segundo Correas 2011 Valle Las Acequias Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
7054,"Baked bread and brown sugar make this a comforting wine in some sense. Similarly, the fruit follows a baked quality that makes it taste bigger than it is. Meanwhile, herbal leanings betray the wine's low level of alcohol.",Ramspur 2012 Otton Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros)
7055,"Fleshy aromas of melon and peach are leesy and soft. This is more angular and acidic on the palate, which fails to fan out. Nectarine and salty briny flavors finish with papaya and peach notes.",Aljibes 2014 VA Viña Aljibes Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
7056,"Leesy, creamy aromas of vanilla are simple, with a note of apple offering some crispness. The palate is regular in feel, with adequate acidity. Flavors of green apple, lettuce and herbs culminate with mild bitterness and green notes.",Baron De Ley 2014 White (Rioja)
7057,"Made in a relatively light-bodied, soft style, this wine has a weedy, herbal element at its heart, and could use more fruit to balance out. It ends in a taste of bittersweet chocolate and espresso.",Buena Vista 2012 Merlot (Carneros)
7058,"For a Cahors, this is a surprisingly light and gently fruity wine. It is dry, with some tannic character, but it is much more about youthful black fruit flavors than it is about structure. It is ready to drink now",Clément Bosquet 2014 Malbec (Cahors)
7059,"Made from Syrah, this pink-colored rosé is ripe and full. Full-on strawberry flavors have a bitter edge as well as acidity. It needs to be drunk now.",Domaine d'Arton 2014 Ysé Rosé (Côtes de Gascogne)
7060,"A tropical fruit flavored wine with yellow fruits, pineapple and mango. It is soft and very ripe although still showing some of the fresher acidity that should be in an Alvarinho wine. It's a long way from the cool north of Portugal.",Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2014 Senses Alvarinho (Alentejano)
7061,"Orange peel aromas are a bit stony. In the mouth, this feels like it's past its prime, with little to no intensity or acidity. Mild apple flavors are sweet, mealy and honeyed, while the ending is leesy and mushy.",Castro Martin 2013 Family Estate Selection Albariño (Rías Baixas)
7062,"An oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms. This has a chunky palate with oxidized, somewhat bitter flavors of papaya and citrus fruits. A pithy mildly bitter finish struggles to show its virtues.",Vieira de Plata 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
7063,"This wine shows the tropical fruit side of Sauvignon Blanc with pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity is there, floral and ripe. The wine is ready to drink now.",Wines & Winemakers 2014 Companhia das Lezírias Tyto Alba Vinhas Protegidas Sauvignon Blanc (Tejo)
7064,"Light apple and floral aromas lead to rich flavors like apple, honey and grapefruit and a definite sweetness. This wine is fresh and easy to enjoy.",Twisted 2013 Moscato (California)
7065,"Stalky aromas of corn, apple and white flowers lack focus. This feels blocky, while salty flavors of cured ham blend with leesy flavors of papaya and peach. A moderate basic finish is par for the course.",Paso a Paso 2014 White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
7066,"Ripe and fruity, this is a rich style of rosé. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Aragonez, it is full of ripe raspberry and red plum flavors that are soft and generous, although lacking acidity. Drink now.",Herdade do Rocim 2014 Mariana Rosé (Alentejano)
7067,"This fresh, vibrant wine is light and fruity. A classic blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, it has an herbal character along with bright green and citrus fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",Château Laulerie 2014 White (Bergerac Sec)
7068,"Offering a flat opening with no kick, it is akin to sniffing apple juice. This is plump and wan in feel, with melon and banana flavors, while a soft, no-edge finish doesn't leave much of a lasting impression.",Egeo 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
7069,"Aromas of scorched earth, game, burned rubber and a funky whiff of barnyard waft out of the glass and carry over to the dense palate along with raisin, fig, licorice and a gamy note. It's rustic and extremely evolved with an abrupt, bitter finish.",Costa di Bussia 2011 Vigna Campo del Gatto  (Barbera d'Alba)
7070,"This wine, aged in stainless steel barrels, offers muted berry fruit, somewhat masked by aromas of rubber tire and plastic. The finish is short and slightly bitter.",Oak Knoll 2012 Dion Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
7071,"With some earthy, rustic flavors the wine seems to have missed out on some of its fruit. It is more about structure and firm tannins with only hints of juicy fruit behind.",Wines & Winemakers 2013 Monta da Baía Red (Península de Setúbal)
7072,"There's 10% Zinfandel blended into this wine, but looking at my notes, I never would've thought so. The pale color is all Pinot Noir, as are the aromas of earth and tomato (the vanilla comes from the French oak barrels). It's light and crisp, with a tart finish.",Fowles Wine 2012 Are You Game? Pinot Noir (Victoria)
7073,"Direct and thin, this Merlot has simple currant, cocoa, licorice and oakspice flavors that finish totally dry.",Wente 2005 Crane Ridge Merlot (Livermore Valley)
7074,"Simple and sugary, with blackberry and cherry jam flavors and a solid plaster of sweet, caramelized oak. Production was 20,000 cases.",Folie à Deux 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
7075,"From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.",Gimenez Riili 2007 Perpetuum Torrontés (La Rioja)
7076,"Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.",Achaval-Ferrer 2007 Malbec (Mendoza)
7077,Not much going on in this off-dry wine. It has very thin flavors of vanilla and pineapples.,Baywood 2006 Vineyard Select Symphony (California)
7078,"Way too oaky. Compromised by the clumsy, heavy application of wood. The caramel and roasted butterscotch aromas and flavors completely swamp whatever wine lies beneath.",Wente 2006 The Nth Degree Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
7079,"This producer in Corgoloin has made a lightweight red Burgundy, with bitter cherry flavors. The tannins are soft, the effect somewhat rustic with an earthy, high acid aftertaste.",Louis d'Armont 2006  Bourgogne
7080,"Simple, tannic and harsh, with sugared blackberry tea, raisin and black pepper flavors.",Midnight 2005 Malbec (Paso Robles)
7081,"De Bortoli's 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir lacks the bright fruit and user-friendliness of its Gulf Station or Windy Peak bottlings. Maybe it's too serious for its own good? This medium-bodied wine features leather, mushroom and molasses, and rather crisp acids as well.",De Bortoli 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)
7082,"Aromas of sour cherry and cooked strawberries lead the way in this tart, herbal Pinot Noir. It's lean and crisp, failing to deliver much in the way of pleasure, although there's nothing technically wrong with it.",Giant Steps 2006 Sexton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)
7083,"Simple and sweet, this Primitivo has jammy flavors of black raspberries, cherries and chocolate. It's a little heavy and soft.",Brutocao 2005 Contento Vineyard Primitivo (Mendocino)
7084,"This is light and seems a little sparkly, as if there is a hint of secondary fermentation going on. For Cab Franc it's light and generic, without the spice or substance of the grape.",Maryhill 2005 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
7085,"Tastes raisiny, overripe and sweet in cherry jam flavor, with a harsh, peppery mouthfeel. Basically drinkable, but not going anywhere.",Verve 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
7086,"Like the '03, this Merlot is a little too sweet for comfort, showing sugary cherry flavors that taste like melted jam. It's also very soft and lacks a firm structure.",Deerfield Ranch 2004 Cuveé Merlot (North Coast)
7087,"Edgy, nervy and funky, with unfamiliar aromas and flavors. The nose is pickled and the palate is tart, linear and green. Loses itself as it opens, turning more herbal, sweaty and strange. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",Tamaya 2007 Winemaker's Selection Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley)
7088,"Smells raisiny-Porty, and turns dry and austere in the mouth, with modest currant and oak flavors set off by hard tannins. The official alcohol is only 14.9%, but the wine feels hotter than that.",Arns 2004 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
7089,"Shows blackberry and cherry flavors that taste candied, almost medicinal. Okay with burgers and pizza.",Jacuzzi 2006 Morine Ranch Primitivo (Lake County)
7090,"Aggressive and ultra-bubbly, with gassy apple, pear and pineapple aromas. The palate runs sharp, with green apple controlling the flavor profile. Sudsy and monotone on the finish, with a bland, green-ish aftertaste.",Trapiche NV Extra Brut Sparkling (Mendoza)
7091,"Chunky, dark and muddled, with flavors of cooked rhubarb and hard spice. Seems thick on the palate and pickled on the finish. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",Tamaya 2007 Pink Goat Rosé (Limarí Valley)
7092,"Undurraga has never been know for sparkling wines, and this brut isn't going to help much. It smells okay, with applesauce and lemon-lime stirring intrigue. But the palate and feel are off. It's foamy in the mouth, with undefined white-fruit flavors. Not ready for prime time.",Undurraga NV Brut  (Maipo Valley)
7093,"Neither overpowering nor impressive. In fact, this is a flat, underdeveloped Torrontés with aromas of air freshener and flavors of banana, papaya and sugared doughnuts. It's not awful but it's the kind of wine that does nothing but fall apart once the cork is pulled.",Bodega Don Bosco 2007 Torrontés (Maipú)
7094,"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",Finca El Origen 2007 Gran Reserva Malbec (Uco Valley)
7095,"This is the first Torrontés from Pascual Toso that we've rated, and if it's any indication of what's going on there, then we say stick to the reds. This is a borderline dud, with chunky, hollow flavors and a mealy finish. Not a total mess but not a good, vivacious Argentine Torrontes by any stretch.",Pascual Toso 2007 Torrontés (Maipú)
7096,"Having liked the 2007 rosé from Los Vascos, this pickled, citric burner just doesn't cut it. It shows Sauvignon Blanc-like flavors and acidity, while the finish is sour and briney. Devoid of the charm and pleasantries that rosé should deliver.",Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2008 Los Vascos Rosé (Colchagua Valley)
7097,"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.",Signorello 2005 Padrone Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)
7098,"Fresh and perfumed, this wine has fine acidity along with bright berry flavors. The freshness suggests it is still young and needs to broaden out with its juicy, black currant aftertaste. In style it is dry, balance by a bright final acidity.",Cockburn's 2009 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
7099,"Grapefruit and stony aromas grace the nose in front of a lightly spritzy palate. Flavors of mixed tropical fruits show notes of bell pepper and white pepper dust, while nectarine and grapefruit flavors drive the finish.",Cyatho 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
7100,"Aromas of spring flowers and fresh orchard fruit lead the nose on this bright, fun sparkler. The palate doles out green apple, pear and citrus alongside zesty acidity and invigorating bubbles.",De Faveri 2014 GeG  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
7101,Frothy fizz carries fresh lemon and lime scents to the surface. The palate has the same citric flavor profile and is diffuse with lots of bubbles—which exaggerates the lightness of the dry palate even more. While there is not a lot of substance there certainly is lots of refreshment.,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Tradition Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
7102,"The strawberry notes of this pink sparkler come with the flavor of cream soda. The fizz foams in a light, airy froth and makes the flavors dance on the dry, uncomplicated palate. This is fun and should be drunk as soon as possible.",Domaine François Schmitt NV Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
7103,"Made with 100% Chardonnay, this sparkler opens with aromas of yellow apple, toasted nut and breadcrumb. The bright palate offers pear, citrus and walnut alongside small, vivacious bubbles.",Dorigo NV Blanc de Blancs Pas Dosé Metodo Classico Chardonnay (Vino Spumante)
7104,"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats. A hint of Band-Aid comes up in the finish, but does not distract.",Chehalem 2013 Ridgecrest Vineyards Gamay Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
7105,"While labeled Extra Brut, this wine is on the sweeter side of this description. An attractive tang of lemon zest goes with the smooth creamed-apple flavors. The aftertaste is fresh and fruity, ready to drink.",Collet NV Extra Brut  (Champagne)
7106,"Hints of oak smooth out the inherent herbal character of the grape, yielding ripe tones of apricot and pineapple. This wine is ripe and fruity and ready to drink.",Fiuza 2014 Premium Sauvignon Blanc (Tejo)
7107,"Mumm's nonvintage cuvée is a soft Champagne, although now drier than in the past with attractive apple and pear flavors that are cut by citrus. It is lightly textured, hinting at almonds and with perfumed acidity at the end. This bottling is ready to drink.",G. H. Mumm NV Cordon Rouge Brut  (Champagne)
7108,"This wine is bright, fruity and packed with berries and juicy black cherries. The acidity gives a fresh character that balances the sweetly ripe fruits. Ready to drink, this is a deliciously fruity wine.",Poças 2010 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
7109,"Given time to ferment and age in a majority of neutral oak, this wine still offers thickness and viscosity. It's rich and lush in tropical pineapple, mango and sliced peach, buoyed by acidity and a focused approach.",Pride Mountain 2013 Vintner Select Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
7110,"Pale in color, this wine offers appealing, very varietal aromas of strawberry, cherry, sarsaparilla and coffee. It's quite elegant in style with strawberry and cinnamon flavors that show persistence.",Primarius 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
7111,"This one-barrel bottling is quite intriguing, offering unexpected aromas and flavors. An element of crunched grapeseeds and unfermented wine grapes mixes with licorice, olive and pepper on the nose. A similar sense pervades the palate, along with light coffee and brown tea flavors. It's slightly odd, but also an interesting change of pace.",Sanguis 2012 1/1 Syrah (Central Coast)
7112,"Reserved aromatically, this wine from the longtime Santa Barbara producer shows bits of plum, hibiscus and graphite on the nose. The palate is surprisingly lush and punchy, with plum and other dark purple-fruit flavors as well as licorice.",Santa Barbara Winery 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
7113,"A 100% varietal Pinot, this wine has a faint bouquet of ripe black cherry and blackberry, exuding full flavor and body. Smooth, the oak is low impact, providing extra weight and sustenance while remaining balanced with the fruit.",Siduri 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
7114,"Clean, attractive aromas of fynbos and orange blossom add character to the fresh citrus and white melon core. The palate is light and vibrant, with pleasantly refreshing acidity and a subtly spiced pear-flavored finish. Enjoy now.",Simonsig 2014 Sunbird Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
7115,"A light, refreshing version of the variety from the heart of the Russian River, this traffics in medium-bodied peach and lime, ending with a sweetness of acidity.",Sonoma-Cutrer 2014 Winemaker's Release Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
7116,"Peach and passion fruit aromas lead the way on this sparkler. The frothy palate shows tropical fruit, Granny Smith apple and kiwi alongside racy acidity and brisk, medium-sized bubbles that lend a fun vibe.",Il Follo 2014 Villa Luigia Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
7117,"Billed as Extra Brut, the wine in fact tastes closer to the sweeter Brut because there is so much attractive apple and crisp pear fruitiness. The aftertaste is balanced, soft and creamy.",Jacquart NV Extra Brut  (Champagne)
7118,"This opens with aromas of spring flowers, tropical fruit and a whiff of peach. The vibrant palate delivers creamy Granny Smith apple, underripe pear and a citrus note alongside bright acidity and a creamy mousse.",La Gioiosa NV Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
7119,"This opens with floral aromas of jasmine, wisteria and a whiff of exotic fruit. The off-dry palate doles out white peach, pineapple, Granny Smith apple and candied citrus zest, accompanied by a frothy mousse and bright acidity.",Villa Sandi NV Cuvée Oris  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
7120,"A grapy, meaty, feral nose is wild, floral and herbal as a whole. This blend of Tempranillo and other Rioja varieties is tannic along its walls. Saucy, grapy, salty flavors are powerful, while the finish is tannic, voluminous and once again grapy like the nose and palate.",Vivanco 2012 Colección Vivanco 4 Varietales Tempranillo-Graciano-Garnacha-Mazuelo  (Rioja)
7121,"Tannins form a dark barrier to start this wine. It is still young, dense with chocolate as well as fruit flavors, showing the bitter, tough flavors that come from too much extraction. The fruit will hopefully come through and soften the tannins and bring out the richness. Drink from 2018.",Yohan Lardy 2014 Les Michelons  (Moulin-à-Vent)
7122,"Pear and peach aromas lead the nose while the brisk palate offers lemon, lime, grapefruit and a mineral note. Zesty acidity and vigorous, persistent bubbles provide the racy framework.",Zardetto 2014 Viti di San Mor Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
7123,"One of the more reliable, affordably priced Rhône blends in the state, this mix of 43% Grenache, 34% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 8% Counoise offers slightly shy aromas of black and red licorice, red currant and cinnamon candy, tucked behind a layer of slate. The palate is more simplistic, with purple fruits most prevalent.",Beckmen 2012 Cuvee Le Bac Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
7124,"Mild applesauce aromas are reticent but clean. This feels fresh, stony, acidic and narrow on the palate. Briny, citrusy flavors are more generic than particular, while the finish tastes like briny citrus, with an aftertaste of salty tang.",Bodegas Landaluce 2014 White (Rioja)
7125,"This wine plays out broadly across the palate, showing tart berries and espresso components, along with a whiff of asparagus. The fruit is somewhat thin and front-loaded, with barrel flavors of toast and cigar box masking some—not all—of the herbaceousness.",Burrowing Owl 2011 Meritage (Okanagan Valley)
7126,"Peach, pear, melon and vanilla aromas come with an aromatic sensation of wet rocks. Light and lifted on the palate, with honeydew, pear, lemon and stony flavors, this finishes fresh, clean and lightly powdery, with echoes of apple and pear.",François Lurton 2015 Piedra Negra Alta Colección Pinot Gris (Valle de Uco)
7127,"Lemon custard, ripe Gala apples and a seemingly sweet candy element show on the nose of this wine from a family-owned producer. Bright energy and ripe apple characterize the palate, along with green pear skins and stonefruit.",Joullian 2014 Family Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Carmel Valley)
7128,"Strawberry fruit is mixed in with fresh, pungent herbs—a mix that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains terroir. Fruity, full and forward, this ripe and pleasing wine is balanced just right for near-term enjoyment.",Torii Mor 2009 Hawks View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
7129,"This wine is a great example of why Riesling is so increasingly popular. Despite the “dry” title on the label, it's actually a bit off-dry and crisp in acidity, with clean, savory flavors of limes, kiwi fruits, honey and vanilla. So easy to like, and the alcohol is relatively low.",V. Sattui 2010 Dry Riesling (Napa Valley)
7130,"A light style, but still stylish, with finesse and good structure. The pretty plum fruit is lightly dusted with cocoa, softening the tannins and adding spice to the finish. A gentle and beguiling wine, ready for near-term enjoyment.",Hedgeline 2010 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
7131,"A blend of typical Alentejo grapes, this is a firm effort, with the fruit laced inbetween the complex tannic structure. The acidity gives the wine a final lift.",Herdade do Esporão 2010 4 Quatro Castas Red (Alentejano)
7132,"Neutral up front except for green apple and mineral aromas. Feels quite good and healthy, with juicy acids pushing fresh bell pepper, lime and white peach flavors. Short but fresh and citrusy on the finish.",Chilcas 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
7133,"Dark, luscious and inky in appearance, Antrum shows thick and juicy aromas of jammy fruit, blackberry pie and rum cake. There are hints of dark spice and leather, with a touch of sour fruit and grittiness on the close.",Ciavolich Giuseppe 2005 Antrum  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
7134,"Bright and jammy red cherry, strawberry and raspberry aromas flood the nose of this Syrah-dominated blend, and carry onto the palate. Medium tannins add a bit of structure, while the finish is clean, with a mouthwatering sensation.",Clos des Augustins 2010 Les Bambins Red (Coteaux du Languedoc Pic Saint Loup)
7135,"Minearally and fresh on the nose, with hints of grass, lime and apple. Good and round in the mouth, with ample acidic punch and lively flavors of nopal, citrus and tarragon. Mellow and just zesty enough on the finish.",Ventisquero 2011 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
7136,"Appropriately named “Passion,” this hearty red wine expresses itself with opulence and generosity. Bold fruit layers of blackberry and cherry liqueur are framed by spice and chewy pipe tobacco. There's a ripe, syrupy feel in the mouth, with loads of jammy fruit on the close.",Vigne & Vini 2008 Passione  (Primitivo del Salento)
7137,"Huge, ripe flavors of blackberry and plum jam, mocha, black currants, anise and cedar mark this wine, grown in the rugged hills of southern Monterey County. It's quite tannic and dry, but doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up.",Indigené 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley)
7138,"Rich, ripe and tropical, this calls to mind bananas soaked in cream. Round and lightly spicy, it's a forward, fruit-driven wine with a veneer of spice and toast, but enough acid to keep it lively.",King Estate 2010 Chardonnay (Oregon)
7139,"In the hands of master blender Dirk Niepoort, even a straight tawny style has depth of flavor and intensity. The wine has red fruit, layered with concentrated acidity, a hint of wood aging, and remains fresh and fruity.",Niepoort NV Tawny  (Port)
7140,"A blend of fruit from three different sites, united by their green farming practices, this is clean, fruity and forward. A mouth-pleasing Pinot with generously juicy and pretty cherry flavors.",Panther Creek 2008 Verde Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
7141,"From the Canadian Okanagan, this stylish, well-balanced wine offers a focused mix of flavors—cola, cherry, tobacco and wet stone in particular. It's a fresh and lively palate, with the sort of crisp elegance found in some European Pinots.",Quails' Gate 2009 Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley)
7142,"A warm easygoing wine with aromas of black cherry, menthol and earth. On the palate, the flavors were less intense, and the mint and fruit character had not entirely resolved themselves. The finish, though, was solid and it would probably benefit from a couple of years of cellaring.",Palladino 2005 Bricco delle Olive  (Barbera d'Alba Superiore)
7143,"There's still a sharpness to this wine, even though it's nearly 4 years old. It shows good blackberry, currant and chocolate-covered cherry flavors, but also a greener streak of mint and oregano that probably limits its ageability.",Altamura 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
7144,"Fruity and oaky, with pineapple cream, tangerine sorbet and buttered toast flavors. Made in a ripe, opulent California style.",William Hill Estate 2006 Estate Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
7145,"Lightweight, very herbal Sauvignon Blanc, full of green fruits, lemon zest and refreshing acidity. Ready to drink, it finishes as fresh as can be. Screwcap.",Guy Saget 2010 La Petite Perrière Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
7146,"Dominated by green-fruit aromas and also green veggies, for example bell pepper and asparagus. The body is pretty good and the acid level keeps it kicking, while the flavors run toward vegetal, just like the bouquet. Finishes with a final dose of green beans and capsicum. Seems to be fading.",Cono Sur 2009 Grapes Organically Grown Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)
7147,"This Bordeaux blend feels harsh in the mouth. It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.",Pinanfarina 2006 Vino Rosso Red (Napa Valley)
7148,"A decent but clumsy wine, showing the pitfalls of this variety in California. It's very dry and silky in texture, but hot in alcohol, and there's a burnt taste to the cherry and oak flavors. Not going anywhere.",Longoria 2008 Clover Creek Vineyard Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley)
7149,"An appealing nose of blackberry, plum and cinnamon gives this Lebanese red a sturdy start. Flavors of berry, spicebox and pepper follow, and balanced acids give it food friendly appeal. Not terribly complex, but definitely likeable.",Château Musar 2004 Cuvée Rouge Red (Bekaa Valley)
7150,"This is a very pungent Sauvignon Blanc, aggressive in those green aromas and flavors generally lumped under the descriptive term of gooseberry. It's dry and clean and acidic, with a finish like the juice of Meyer lemons.",Geyser Peak 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
7151,"Chardonnay has not been Silverado's strong suit in recent years and the tight, lean 2008 does not alter that conclusion. The wine is dry and acidic, with citrus and apple flavors that lack charm.",Silverado 2008 Chardonnay (Napa County)
7152,"Green and vegetal in aromas and flavors. The nose deals pea, green bean and asparagus tempered by lime and melon. The palate has weight and a mix of green, grassy flavors as well as apple, lime and pineapple. A jalapeño-like burn is prominent on the finish. Definitely a cool-climate SB.",Anakena 2010 Indo Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)
7153,"The nose is pleasant, packed with peaches and a touch of cinnamon. On the palate the wine is quite intense but the finish given this intensity, is a little shorter than I would have expected.",Tosti NV Torlasco  (Moscato d'Asti)
7154,"This new consumer-friendly brand sports a Garnacha-based rosado and a red blend. The rosé is a bit sweet and mass-market in style, but it has nice color, mouthfeel and integrity. With detectable residual sugar, it's probably better if you have previously enjoyed blush wines. Imported by Cellar Door.",Red Guitar 2006 Old Vine Garnacha Rosé (Navarra)
7155,"Medium gold color. Pronounced aromas of candied citrus and stone fruit. Only moderate flavor intensity across the palate with dominant citrus notes and hints of pear and peach. Simple, and slightly one-dimensional with a warm, shortish finish.",Peter Weber 2007 Gewürztraminer (Alsace)
7156,"A promising nose of blueberries, vanilla and spices. On the palate it was less exciting; the fruit was  muted, and there was not much else showing. The finish proved surprisingly long, and as the wine lay in the glass, it did show signs of improvement.",Gruppo Casaleone 2001 Rosa del Marchese  (Barbera d'Asti)
7157,"A pleasant wine to drink, and a decent value. On the nose, it shows sweet, slightly roasted fruit, a touch of earth, but on the palate, although it begins well, the flavors disappears half way in, so there is little at the end and a thin finish.",Michele Chiarlo 2005 Le Orme  (Barbera d'Asti)
7158,"One of the weakest wines in our group of 2003 Barolos from a producer whose wines are usually a lot better. It began with aromas of strawberry and dried cranberry. Quite thin on the palate, it showed some low level fruit, a good  deal of acid, and a long but slightly sour finish.",Tenimenti Ca' Bianca 2003  Barolo
7159,"An austere wine that on the nose has little fruit although it has a slight  mineral component and a touch of weediness. On the palate, the mineral becomes more intense but that may be more due to the  absence of fruit. Slightly hollow in the mid palate, but the finish is surprisinly long.",Tosti NV Prosecco (Italy)
7160,"The wine shows many of the characteristics of the vintage; slightly overripe and plummy, not much definition and plenty of alcohol. On the palate, there is plenty of raisiny fruit is at the front of the palate, but little else and the wine is hot and a little unbalanced, and there is slight bubblegum aftertaste.",Ca'Romè 2003 Vigna Cerretta  (Barolo)
7161,"This was a difficult wine to taste. It was seriously extracted but it did not show a lot of fruit, and showed a slightly sweaty component. On the palate it was heavy and slightly coarse, but redeemed itself with a medium finish where some fruit came through.",Il Falchetto 2004 Lurëi  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
7162,"Thin and tart, sharp citrus rind scents and flavors; then an unexpectedly sugary note in the finish.",Fujishin 2009 Bitner Vineyard Viognier

7167,"Winemaker Alana McGettigan is an associate of Matt Thomson (Saint Clair, Delta), so it's no surprise this Sauvignon Blanc overdelivers. Hints of tomato leaf garnish passion fruit and citrus flavors in this wine, which reveals a certain amount of austerity and restraint on the palate, a silky texture and a long, grapefruit-driven finish.",Fire Road 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
7168,"Made from 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 41% Syrah, 8% Petit Verdot and 6% Cabernet Franc, this blend has a rich nose of black cherry with strong touches of minerality.

7171,"Some wineries releasing a new Garys' Syrah would charge a lot more, but Novy keeps their prices moderate. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle. Given the extreme dryness and tannins, as well as significant alcohol, the question is will the wine age. It doesn't seem likely to, so decant and drink up through 2020.",Novy 2011 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)

Drink now–2018.",Vilafonté 2010 Series M Red (Paarl)
7179,"This Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.",Vinyes del Terrer 2010 Terrer d'Aubert Red (Tarragona)

7181,"From a 100-acre estate formerly the home of the Counts of Provence, this wine has a great fruity character allied to a more mineral texture. With richness and vanilla flavors it is both packed with raspberry fruits and showing structure. Keep until the end of 2014.",Château Réal Martin 2013 Perle de Rosé (Côtes de Provence)

7188,"Rich and velvety, it carries an important mouthfeel consisting of firm tannins, good acidity and a firm, minerally grounding. Fruit is the star, filling the mouth with blackberries and black currants, and a smoky coating of oak. With a dry finish, it's drinking very well now, and will soften through 2018.",Emblem 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
7189,"Initially, this comes across as being baked out and tired, but give it time to spread out and it reveals mature, earthy, leafy aromas and a round palate with choppy, firm tannins. Earthy flavors of dried cherry, Christmas spices and chocolate yield to licorice on the finish. Drink now.",Ferré I Catasús 2008 Terra de Fic 2 Red (Priorat)
7190,"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The wine remains tough, dry and scoury at the age of 11 years, showing its yeastiness and subtle flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. It's elegant, but probably not going anywhere, so drink up. Sushi will be an ideal companion.",Gloria Ferrer 2003 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros)
7191,"Long-time Cloudy Bay winemaker Kevin Judd has been out on his own for several vintages, and this is a fine effort. The characteristic herbal, grassy elements of Marlborough are present, but toned-down, making this wine an easier fit with a variety of foodstuffs. A pleasant plumpness to the mouthfeel turns dry and chalky on the long finish.",Greywacke 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)

7267,"An exuberant boysenberry jam aroma and richly layered berry and dark chocolate flavors give lots of taste pleasure to this full-bodied and impressively textured wine.

7280,"Ground pepper, Alpine herbs and spiced blueberry unfold in the glass.

7294,"This blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 25% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 5% Counoise shows blackberry, rose petal, hibiscus and Dr. Pepper spice touches on the nose.

7295,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (57%), Merlot (25%), Cabernet Franc (14%) and Petit Verdot all coming from Quintessence Vineyard.

7297,"The blend is 55% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 20% Mourvèdre, but while this is a full-bodied wine, it's not overdone or bombastic.

Bright acidity carries them into the finish.",Baily 2016 Montage Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Temecula Valley)

7302,"This is one compact package of citrus flavors: the nose is shy but the palate is a slender, taut but expressive parcel of zesty lemon and lime notes. This is dry, utterly refreshing and clean.

Michelle 2015 Canoe Ridge Estate Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills)
7305,"Despite coming from the warmest vintage on record for the state, this wine displays a very pleasing sense of restraint. Aromas of straw, clarified butter and peach are followed by well-balanced, textured fruit flavors. An elegant styling only heightens the appeal.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2015 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
7306,A light touch of toastiness gives this Despagne family wine extra richness. It offers spice as well as plenty of crisp green and citrus fruits. The two elements balance and will allow this wine to age well. Drink from late 2017 or even early 2018.,Château Tour de Mirambeau 2016 Réserve  (Bordeaux Blanc)

This enlivens and refreshes and has a totally uplifting lemony finish.",Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2016 Les Hospices Riesling (Alsace)
7312,"The nose is a little subdued. The palate comes in with a creamy poised richness that holds ripe peach, rose petal and grapefruit zest. There is a pleasant streak of bitterness that channels the richness of the concentrated fruit. The finish is just off dry, clean and zesty.",Domaine Pfister 2015 Tradition Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
7313,"The winery has had some success with this Spanish variety, but the '05 is not one of their best efforts. The wine is thinly structured and harsh in tannins, with exaggerratedly sweet cherry, cola and currant flavors.",Martin & Weyrich 2005 Flamenco Rojo Tempranillo (Paso Robles)

7317,"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",Señorío de Sarria 2005 Vino Dulce Natural Moscatel (Navarra)
7318,"This is a creative if not entirely successful wine; its intense, lavish aromas are followed by a surprisingly rustic wave of fruit that has a spin of austerity to it. One-dimensional and rough around the edges.",Lucas Vineyards 2005 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
7319,"Soft and thick in the mouth, even heavy, with ripe pie-filling flavors of blackberries and cherries that finish sweet.",Cinnabar 2004 Cabernet Franc (Lodi)
7320,"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.",Standing Stone 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
7321,Ketchup aromas are pungent and a bit overwhelming. It's too bad because the wine tastes good thanks to its firm structure.,Tenuta Sette Ponti 2005 Vigna di Pallino Sangiovese (Toscana)

7323,"Thin and light. Solid flavors of red cherry and berry jam lead into a short but lively finish. With virtually no tannins, this is a suitable choice for lighter chicken or fish dishes.",Kadesh Barnea 2004 Estate Bottled Reserve Kosher Merlot (Negev Hills)
7324,"Lacking intensity, the nose exhibits mild notes of ripe red apple while the palate adds a touch of canteloupe. Fat and round with a fleeting finish, the wine never really makes a strong impression.",Fortant 2005 Kosher Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
7325,"Though a touch green on the nose, that's countered by plenty of wood and vanilla. Hints of plum, faded cherry and licorice appear in the mouth, with a sweet, cedary finish. Drink now.",Barkan 2005 16 Months Barrel Aged Kosher Tempranillo (Samson)
7326,"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine. This is a funky, earthy specimen with burnt notes and a grassy aftertaste.",Valsanzo 2005 Vall Sanzo  (Ribera del Duero)
7327,"Sharp and medicinal, with the taste of plastic bandages and cherry-mint candies; very tannic.",Wellington 2004 Mohrhardt Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
7328,"Subtle aromas of cherry and cinnamon spice are followed by an overly tart, acidic character on this wine from historic Brotherhood. Light and somewhat one dimensional, it does have a clean finish and its minerality will recommend it to food pairing.",Brotherhood 2005 Pinot Noir (New York)
7329,"There's a lack of balance, with thin, slightly bitter fruit overriding any complexity that may have been achieved with more oak. This is not offensive, it just lacks character.",Damiani 2006 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
7330,"Something went south on this Cabernet-Syrah blend, and the problem probably was the Cab, because the winery's regular Syrah is really good. This wine is sharp and vinegary, with sweet and sour cherry flavors.",La Capilla 2005 Melange Red (Paso Robles)
7331,"Sweet and simple, with jellied blackberry and cherry flavors, harsh tannins and a sugary finish.",Esser Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
7332,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",Eleusis 2006 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
7333,"Too sweet by far for a table wine, with simple, medicinal cherry and blackberry flavors and a harshly tannic mouthfeel.",Esser Cellars 2005 Zinfandel (California)
7334,"Excessively ripe fruit verging on baked, burnt blackberries, hard tannins and residual sweetness.",Vina Robles 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
7335,"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”",Avignonesi 1995 Occhio di Pernice  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano)
7336,"This is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years.",Talley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
7337,"This is a muscular Merlot, exotic in cinnamon/cardamom spice that's otherwise soft, structured and complex. The tannins are most pronounced on the finish and need time to further integrate, but make the wine long-lasting in leathery cassis and tobacco flavor.",Occasio 2010 Thatcher Bay Vineyard Merlot (Livermore Valley)
7338,"Inky black in color, with hard tannins, this Petite Sirah is drinkable now only because it's so soft in acidity and fruity.

The perfect food accompaniment will be grilled beef.",Peachy Canyon 2011 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)

7342,"The excellent Olsen vineyards provided the fruit for this pure Malbec. It's still quite young, showing clean and tightly-wound flavors. Berry and cherry fruit highlights the palate, with a light hint of chocolate woven through the finish.",Market Vineyards 2010 Merval Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
7343,"Fragrances recall wet leaves, underbrush, forest berries and baking spices with a touch of espresso.

This is a big wine, but the fruit isn't quite rich enough to support the evident alcohol.",Mastrojanni 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
7344,"A solid effort, in the mainstream style that you'll find on many restaurant-chain wine lists. Apricot jelly—not jam—flavors carry through all the way, with a clean, crisp, well-balanced finish. The residual sugar is just under 30 g/L.",Pacific Rim 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
7345,"A brawny wine, it leads with ripe berry, underbrush, toast and leather aromas. The juicy palate offers sweet wild cherry and black raspberry accented with notes of mint, thyme, black pepper and hint of coffee alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2015–2021.",Palazzo 2009  Brunello di Montalcino

7347,"A quirky blend of six wildly-different white grapes, this has some sweet fruit, some bitter phenolics, and a noticeable honeyed character, suggesting that there was some botrytis in the mix. Rich and loaded with flavors of lemon curd, apricot and ripe peaches, it's a creative, interesting wine, worth exploring at this price.",Patterson 2012 Forbidden White (Columbia Valley (WA))
7348,"This forward wine opens with aromas that recall mature black plum, grilled herbs and meat juices with whiffs of farmyard and leather.

Drink through 2019.",Piccini 2009 Villa al Cortile  (Brunello di Montalcino)
7349,"It shows earthy aromas of wet soil and leafy underbrush, as well as leather, dark berry and spice.

The fruit richness is starting to fade so enjoy soon rather than later.",Pietroso 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
7350,"Dry and medium-bodied, this Pinot has nice raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, as well as brisk acidity. Toasted oak shows up as smoky, brown butter sauce. The earthiness suggests pairing with a rich risotto of butternut squash or wild mushrooms.",Poseidon 2012 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros)

7352,"Balsam, menthol, spice and black and red berry aromas with hints of mint lead the nose on this wine. The palate offers subtle red cherry, prune, tea and tobacco alongside velvety but rather fleeting tannins. It closes on a drying, astringent note.",San Giacomo 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
7353,"One of the few varietal bottlings produced in the state, this concrete-fermented wine brings notes of straw, wet stone, herbs and citrus zest. It's tart and mouthwatering with lemony acidity and a textured feel, screaming out for shellfish to be served alongside it.",Syncline 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Columbia Gorge (WA))
7354,"Dusty dark-fruit aromas are lusty and full of oaky notes including sawdust and chocolate. This value-priced winner is full, round, saturated and generous on the palate, where savory, resiny black-fruit flavors finish woody in flavor and firm in feel.",Trapiche 2012 Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza)
7355,"Merlot heavily dominates this Right Bank-style wine, with Cabernet Sauvignon accounting for only 11% of the blend. That accounts for the softness and the domination of cherries, red currants and violets. The acidity is mouthwatering. It's an easy-drinking wine, with some aspirations to complexity.",Cameron Hughes 2012 Lot 426 Red Hen Ranch Meritage (Oak Knoll District)
7356,"In this still very young wine, the tannins dominate, but the fruitiness is there to come out later. With power, black fruits and touches of dark chocolate, it will be a fine, rich wine. Drink from 2017.",Château Bibian 2011  Haut-Médoc
7357,"A year's wood aging has left its mark on this wine in the form of burnt smokiness. However, the fruit is rich and full-bodied giving the promise that the wine will smooth out its rough edges. There already is a fine juiciness at the end that comes with great acidity.",Château Cap Léon Veyrin 2011  Listrac-Médoc
7358,"A wood-laden wine, it still manages to bring out its inherent fruitiness. It's a ripe wine, showing spice from the wood and juicy blackberry flavors, well packaged and finished off with acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",Château de Braude 2011  Haut-Médoc
7359,"This Syrah emphasizes herb and spice, keeping the peppery fruit in the background. Nice grip and a pleasing texture contribute to the enjoyment, though the light, grapy flavors make you wonder how well the wine will age.",Helix by Reininger 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
7360,"Honey and almond notes lend a nutty earthiness to lifted citrus aromas. It's concentrated with sweet tangerine flavor, and has a sharp, zesty acidity that drives a moderately long finish.",Heron Hill 2010 Bunch Select Late Harvest Riesling (Finger Lakes)
7361,"This plump Brunello offers layered aromas of black plum, mature berry, vanilla, and balsamic notes with a hint of leather.

7363,"This shows stalky, corny notes on the nose along with mineral and white-fruit scents. There's a lemony quality to an otherwise neutral palate, while saline, lemon and mild but increasing bitterness control the flavor profile and finish.",Zarate 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
7364,"This is a big, ripe rosé, with lush red cherry, rosehip tea, apricot and vanilla flavors. It has zesty acidity and a silky mouthfeel. Some fruity sweetness lingers in the finish, but the wine is essentially dry.",Del Dotto 2012 Cinghiale Vineyard Pinot Noir Rosé (Fort Ross-Seaview)
7365,"Sourced entirely from the Artz vineyard, this Sauvignon Blanc is quite fruity, concentrated, slightly sweet, and drinking optimally. Flavors of melon and citrus carry on through a lush, well-rounded finish.",Eleven 2012 La Donella Sauvignon Blanc (Washington)
7366,"This Bordeaux-style blend is a mix of Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot, tart and falling on the thin side. Wild raspberry fruit is accented with scents and flavors of earth and hay. It's aromatic, astringent, and well-suited for grilled meats.",Elsom Cellars 2009 Autonomous Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
7367,"This seemingly forward Hermitage boasts bold notes of lime, pineapple and melon, wrapped in a soft blanket of toastiness and restrained oak. It's round in the mouth and ample in body, with a long finish faintly suggestive of coffee. Drink now.",Fayolle Fils & Fille 2009 Les Dionnières White (Hermitage)
7368,"Lush, composed and fresh on the bouquet, with blackberry and perfect prune aromas. This is mouthfilling and smooth, with a firm, flush tannic structure and flavors of coconut, lemon rind, herbal black fruit and red berry. It's long and supple late, and it's arguably one of the best Cabernet Sauvignons you'll find from Spain and Navarra.",Finca Albret 2007 La Viña de Mi Madre Reserva Red (Navarra)
7369,"This Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is firm, powerful and polished. The fruit runs the gamut from citrus to melon to white peach, finishing with some youthful bite. Already a succulent, mouthfilling gem, but should improve for another five years.",Insania 2010 White (Red Mountain)
7370,"This oaked Chenin shows great structure and power now, with the potential to cellar nicely for another three years or beyond. Toasted brioche, wood-grilled peaches and quince aromas open up immediately on the bouquet and carry through to the palate alongside seductive accents of sweet spice, almond skin and orange oil. The texture is round and full, and the spice-driven finish is long and satisfying.",Jean Daneel 2010 Signature Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
7371,"This Merlot starts off tough and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants and toasty oak, girded with minerals and spices and finishing totally dry. It feels elegant and balanced, showing a fine sense of control. Drink over the next 5–6 years.",Kendall-Jackson 2009 Grand Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County)
7372,"Expensive, yes, but very fine, especially if you're looking for a Chardonnay that's drier, more elegant and more streamlined than the opulent, buttery modern style. Sleek and crisp in acidity, this features citrus, tropical fruit and mineral flavors, with a balanced addition of smoky oak.",La Rochelle 2010 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
7373,"A very rich Chardonnay that's creamy and smooth in the mouth. A touch of oak and lees gives weight and density to the lime and peach fruit, while brisk acidity contributes brightness. A great price for a wine of this distinction.",Kendall-Jackson 2010 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara-Monterey)
7374,"This has memorable aromas of warm hat, green herbs and perfumed fruit candy. It is a delicious wine that has been aged in cask before bottling.",Kirchmayr 1992 Solist Riesling (Kamptal)
7375,"This shows the chilly vintage in the bright acidity that makes this wine's finish so zesty clean. The flavors are tantalizing, suggesting golden apricots, limes and honey, but are complex in minerals and creamy in lees, making it an intellectual wine.",Lynmar 2010 La Sereinité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
7376,"Pretty rich and full-bodied for Pinot Noir, this is a big wine that grabs your attention. It floods the mouth with flavors of sour cherry candy and spicy persimmons, with a rich overlay of toasty oak and exotic spices. The acidity lends a nice bite. It's too young to appreciate now, but it should gain traction after 2014.",Maggy Hawk 2009 Unforgettable Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
7377,"Shows Pride's house style, a wildly bold, mountain-concentrated wine that couldn't possibly be fruitier or riper. Intense flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cedar are wrapped into complex but gentle tannins, making the wine drinkable now. But it should develop over the next 6–8 years.",Pride Mountain 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Sonoma)
7378,"Delicious and full bodied, this has both weight and delicacy. It is rich and dry, with swathes of ripe apricot and pineapple that cut through the tense acidity. A wine for aging over 5–6 years. Screwcap.",Rabl 2010 Schenkenbichl Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
7379,"A stunning and inviting dessert wine that exhibits the superb balance that Chenin Blanc can lend to the style. Honeyed peach and apricot notes abound, with spicy accents of ginger, clove-spiked orange and toast. The mouth is lush and slightly viscous, but the racy acidity provides good cut. This ends with a long, spice-driven finish. Delicious now, but it should age for another five years.",Ken Forrester 2009 T Noble Late Harvest Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
7380,"Bold as always, with a ton of cedar, graphite, blackberry, vanilla and coconut notes on the nose. This is huge, tough and ripe, with massive blackberry, café mocha and vanilla flavors. It finishes hard but with a cascade of sweet fruit, marshmallow, coconut cake, herb and vanilla. Needs a few more years to settle. Drink after 2013.",Maurodos 2007 San Román  (Toro)
7381,"This cool-climate Riesling, technically off-dry with 2% residual sugar, has very tart, highly extracted flavors, with flavors including tangy citrus, peach, apricot and papaya. The length, acidity, texture, mouthfeel, depth and surpassing freshness are exceptional.",AntoLin Cellars 2010 Glacier Estate Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley)
7382,"With low alcohol and a clean minerality, this Pinot represents the new direction that the variety is taking in California, helped by cooler vintages. It's dry, crisply acidic and complex, with the cherry-berry flavors assisted with notes of earthy herb and mushroom. A lovely wine now, and should gently develop over the next six years.",Babcock 2010 Slice of Heaven Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
7383,"This is the winery's best Marinus since 2007, and is as good as the '04—which is arguably the best ever. It offers immediate pleasure, with soft tannins and acids framing perfectly ripened blackberry, cherry, cola and earthy flavors. Ready to drink now.",Bernardus 2009 Marinus Red Wine Red (Carmel Valley)
7384,"This is the second of Black Kite's 2009 Pinot Noirs to be released, following the Redwood's Edge last year. It's an impressive wine, dry, richly textured and crisp, showing complex cherry compote, chocolate-covered mint, spice and sandalwood flavors. It's clearly delicious, but gains extra charm from the smooth texture and elegance. Drink now-2015.",Black Kite 2009 Angel Hawk Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
7385,"With its Mourvèdre content, this is a big-hearted wine. It is finely balanced between its rich yellow and red fruits and spice and acidity. This is a great food rosé, textured and ripe.",Domaines Ott 2011 Château de Romassan Rosé (Bandol)
7386,"Classic Petite Sirah, in the full-bodied richness, dryness, hard tannins and deep flavors of ripe dark berries and fruits, cocoa, grilled meat and black pepper. As good as that is, it also shows the impeccable balance of a fine Napa Valley red wine. Good now with robust meat stews and roasts, and it should develop for many years.",Elyse 2010 Barrel Select Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
7387,"The 2008 Brookman Syrah is a rich, plush, luxurious wine. Aromas of cedar, vanilla and black cherry set the stage, while the palate features intense dark fruit layered with hints of olive and coffee. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, showing just a touch of warmth on the supple finish. Drink now–2020.",Clarendon Hills 2008 Brookman Syrah (Clarendon)
7388,"This is a top-notch effort—a blend of 80% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre. It starts off with intriguing floral and herbal notes, then delivers deep black-cherry flavors on the palate, tinged with savory nuances of roasted meat and black olive. It's full bodied and round, richly but finely textured and very drinkable now yet with the substance to age up to 10 years or more.",Domaine du Grand Montmirail 2009 Cuvée Vieilles Vignes  (Gigondas)
7389,"This is a tight, black-fruited wine, with generous flavors that include espresso and licorice. At first it's quite firm and a bit unyielding, it slowly peels open layer after layer, tossing out hints of dried herb, tobacco and mocha.",Walla Walla Vintners 2009 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
7390,"This is a sophisticated blend of Carignano, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and it's always delightful. This vintage shows intense, soft notes of dried sage and rosemary.",Agricola Punica 2008 Barrua Red (Isola dei Nuraghi)
7391,"A winner given its quality-to-price quotient. This smells earthy, dark and harmonious, with black plum and berry aromas leading the charge. It feels racy, juicy and full, with giant raspberry, plum, vanilla, tobacco and licorice flavors. It's textured on the finish, with bright, lasting flavors. Drink now.",Cellers Sant Rafel 2005 Solpost Red (Montsant)
7392,"Cabernet Franc is a difficult variety on its own, but Jarvis does an excellent job. This is still quite tannic, with a hard, astringent mouthfeel to the cherry, blackberry and dark-chocolate flavors. Give this a few more years of aging, although it doesn't seem like a longterm ager.",Jarvis 2007 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
7393,"The vintage was cool, lending this wine strong acidity that cuts through the mouth like a squirt of lime juice. Dry and austere, it offers oak-influenced sour-cherry candy and cola flavors. This should develop bottle complexity over the next 3–6 years.",Lynmar 2010 Freestone Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
7394,"One of the best California rosés of the last several years. It's light bodied, crisply acidic, and ultrarefined, with flavors of polished rose, herbal tea, strawberry and spice. So clean and so pure, this is wonderfully dry on the finish.",Lynmar 2011 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
7395,"This is a lovely, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc, with rich aromas of candied fruit, apricot, honeysuckle and amazing aromatic intensity. Thick, creamy and enduring on the palate, this beautiful wine shows the structure for long cellar aging.",Cantina Terlano 2010 Quarz Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
7396,"Here's an exuberant, country-style Zin that's easy to drink with barbecue. It's enormously fruity in blackberries, currants, mulberries and cinnamon-spicy mocha, with firm tannins that need rich meats to unlock. Drink soon.",Sobon Estate 2006 Rezerve Zinfandel (Amador County)
7397,"Rich, soft and spicy, this is a warm, ripe wine. With its flavors of figs, black plums and herbs, it certainly sums up the heat of the Douro, leaving some good fresh acidity to finish.",Sogevinus 2006 Curva Tinto Red (Douro)
7398,"Plenty of smoky, spicy oak on this Chard, along with ripe, orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. It's a little rough around the edges, though. Drink now.",Testarossa 2007 Castello Chardonnay (Central Coast)
7399,"This Zinfandel is bone-dry and classically varietal, with briary, wild berry, black currant, mocha, raisin and peppery spice flavors. But consumers should understand that the alcohol is 16.7%. It's a great example of a superripe Sonoma Zin, but be careful to not drink too much.",Valdez 2005 Rockpile Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
7400,"Rich and exotic, this Zin offers a blast of ripe wild blackberry, briary currants, mulberry, mocha, pepper and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a strongly flavored wine that needs powerful fare to match it.",XYZin 2006 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
7401,"A Bordeaux blend made from this high plateau between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Tastes rugged and immature, with bright blackberry, currant and cedar flavors wrapped into tough tannins. Too powerful now. Try after 2010.",Elements of Sonoma 2004 E3 Red (Knights Valley)
7402,"Almost overripe, with oak-inspired currant and plum flavors that veer into raisins. But the wine is bone-dry and soft, with mellowing notes of chocolate. Finishes in a swirl of peppery spice.",Forchini 2006 Proprietor's Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
7403,"With its vanilla buttercream and spicy, smoky overtones, this Chard also shows underlying fruit flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and green apples. It's a crisp, supple young wine, and this is a good price to pay.",Gallo Family Vineyards 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
7404,"Gary Farrell's Bordeaux blend is quite good and well-made, but it isn't showing much complexity now. It's a big, tannic wine that impresses with its blast of fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, cocoa all swamp the palate, along with smoky oak notes. Maybe it will do interesting things in the cellar.",Gary Farrell 2004 Encounter Red (Sonoma County)
7405,"An atypical offering, this full-bodied Riesling possessing a slightly oily texture is saturated with a creamy butteryness and earthy essences such as mushroom and truffle. While hints of white peach might surface in the mouth, it is surprisingly easy to take pleasure in its other slightly odd and unexpected characteristics.",Marc Kreydenweiss 2005 Au Dessus de la Loi Andlau Riesling (Alsace)
7406,"Here's a light, spicy, pretty red wine, mixing juicy and sweet plum and purple grape flavors with plenty of acid. You might pick up hints of tobacco, a little white pepper; the acids keep the wine fresh and the fruit is youthful and vibrant.",Abacela 2006 Umpqua Cuvée Tempranillo (Southern Oregon)
7407,"Surely there is no other Syrah-Tempranillo-Merlot-Dolcetto-Graciano-Petit Verdot-Nebbiolo-Cabernet Franc-Grenache-Muscat-Viognier-Tannat-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon in the world? What's it taste like? Well, red table wine is as good a description as can be offered. Racy red fruits, mineral, bitter chocolate, good grip, spicy tannins—bring on the burgers.",Abacela NV Vintner's Blend #9 Red Table Wine Red (Southern Oregon)
7408,"A blended style of Madeira, this is rich, soft, without the ineffable bite of a wine made from the classic varieties, but certainly with acidity and wood as well as a full, caramel-flavored aftertaste.",Blandy's NV Duke of Clarence Rich Madeira (Madeira)
7409,"Sharp and tannic, with cherry, blackberry, coffee, cocoa and peppery flavors. Exuberantly rustic now, but could mellow with a year or two in the bottle.",Buena Vista 2005 Merlot (Carneros)
7410,"High acidity gives this wine its mouth-tingling, almost sour taste, but oodles of cherries balance it. It's also pretty tannic. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with meats in rich tomato sauce, garlic and cheese.",Ca' del Solo 2006 Dolcetto (Monterey County)
7411,This inexpensive Pinot Gris has pear fruit with spicy highlights that somehow conjure up caraway. It's wrapped in yeasty flavors of fresh-baked bread and plenty of lemony acid.,Cloudline 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
7412,"For a wine at this price, this is an impressive performance. It is rich, finely structured, the juicy blackberry flavors filling the mouth. It may lack complexity, but the spice, tobacco and berry flavors are enjoyably drinkable.",Dão Sul 2006 Cortello Touriga Nacional (Estremadura)
7413,"A good Cabernet, if a little gritty, with herb-infused flavors of black currants, plums and spices. Might soften with a few years in the bottle, but not really a longterm ager.",Francis Ford Coppola 2006 Director's Cut Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
7414,"Honey, flower and melon leads on this delicate Riesling from Hazlitt. Juicy, full flavors of melon and citrus are balanced with a crisp minerality that lingers in the finish. Complex and energetic.",Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes)
7415,"The Macari No 1 offers an aromatic nose of grapefruit and tropical fruit, followed by crisp citrus and mineral flavors. The wine is balanced and refreshing, but has complexity. Pair with Thai or Indian dishes.",Macari 2007 No 1 Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island)
7416,"Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.",Marqués de Cáceres 2005 Crianza  (Rioja)
7417,"Those who seek out Gewürztraminer for its intense, exotic nose will want to look elsewhere. Despite the subtle aromatic profile, the rich palate is bursting with flavors of rose water, spice and cloves. It finishes fairly dry, with just a hint of residual sugar.",Pierre Sparr 2006 Reserve Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
7418,"Dry and softly tannic, this is a nice Cab to drink now with steaks and chops. It has herb-infused flavors of black currants and cherries, with a spicy edge.",Trentadue 2005 Geyserville Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
7419,"A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness. For basic Priorat, this is fine. But if you're looking for greatness, there isn't much to speak of. Overall, it's a good but regular wine, nothing more or less.",Scala Dei 2006 Negre Red (Priorat)
7420,"Soft berry and pepper spice aromas give this elegant red a mellow start. On the palate, savory meat and cherry flavors are touched with an herbal lift. Smooth and delicate in nature, and a pretty sipping wine.",Koenig Vineyards 2006 Estate Vineyard Merlot
7421,"Creamy and fruity, this Viognier has forward flavors of pineapples, limes, ripe green apples, vanilla, honey and cinnamon spice, balanced with crisp acidity, and totally dry on the finish. It's an easy, enjoyable wine.",Meadowcroft 2007 Viognier (Sonoma County)
7422,"Attractive aromas of mineral and slate are hampered by some musty notes. Nonetheless, the palate is well-structured, with refreshing acidity reinforcing mineral notes. This is an austere, dry style perfect for those who shy away from the fruitier examples.",Domaines Schlumberger 2006 Les Princes Abbés Riesling (Alsace)
7423,"Mature fruit is veneered with oak and kissed with dusty cocoa and dry earth. Although this is losing freshness, it comes off as elegant and the tannins suggest that it may age for just a year or two longer.",Plaisir De Merle 1998 Merlot (Paarl)
7424,"A tart, flinty and apple-y rendition of Riesling, one that's lean and light, one that leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh after swallowing or spitting. One that would make a particularly pleasant aperitif.",Elk Cove 2001 Riesling (Willamette Valley)
7425,"Light and fresh, with hints of peach, citrus, melon, spice and slate. The wine serves up a refreshing mix for spring and summertime sipping. Fruity on the finish. -J.M.",Firestone 2002 Riesling (Central Coast)

7427,"Bright, fresh, fruity and light bodied, with pretty peach, apple and spice flavors that leave a crisp, clean and pleasant finish. Fairly sweet, but refreshing.",J. Lohr 2002 Bay Mist Riesling (Monterey)
7428,"Damp, foresty earth aromas meet those of cherry and dusty cocoa, which carry to the palate of lightweight red fruit. The balance of smooth tannins and gentle acidity is pleasant, but there is room for more heft and complexity overall in this wine.",Thelema 1999 Merlot (Stellenbosch)
7429,"This wine has a thin streak of eucalyptus throughout. As a foil to that green note, there is red licorice, cassis, sweet cherry and blk plum to entice. Pleasant notes of molasses, oiled leather and white pepper round out the palate.",Mas Nicolas 2000 Cape Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
7430,"A nice Cabernet, proper and pleasant, it tastes of blackcurrants and oak and is very dry and balanced. No doubting that it comes from a good vineyard and has been made in a competent style.",Mendocino Gold 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County)
7431,"A well-balanced and straightforward wine, the Tintara is medium-bodied and creamy in the mouth, with stone fruit and vanilla flavors. Butterscotch, and maybe some nuttiness, wraps it up on the finish.",Hardys 2001 Tintara Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
7432,"This funky white blend, now in its 6th rendition, carries no vintage or regional designation, but we know it's a blend of several white grapes grown mostly in Oregon. The nose is ripe and full of melon, while the spunky palate deals orange and lemon, but not in sour-ball fashion. The finish has some thickness and a slight sticky feel, but ample acidity throughout renders it a good, brisk drink.",Sokol Blosser NV Evolution 6th Edition White (Oregon)
7433,"Rustic and funky, with a curious nose sending up scents of fruit, musk, soy, pepper and espresso. Flavors are vivid and grapey, and there is a penetrating spicy note running throughout. The finish is tannic and rough.",Abacela 2000 Cabernet Franc (Oregon)
7434,"This wine seems to reach out to the mainstream: flavors and aromas of sweet vanilla, cinnamon toast and brown sugar are met with lightweight red fruit, a soft balance and just a touch of white pepper. Inoffensive on all counts, but lacks the depth needed to set it apart.",New World 2002 Syrah (Western Cape)
7435,"The balance of this wine has slightly spritzy acidity in the lead, wrapped with sheer tannins. Rich aromas of earth, leather and toast are contrasted by the bright fruit which is a sweet candylike strawberry-cherry at the forepalate.",Niel Joubert 2000 African Tradition Collection - Elephant Shiraz (Paarl)
7436,"Ripely fruity, with sun-warmed flavors of white peach and nectarine. Acids are fine, and boost the structure. There's also a subtle overlay of oak that adds to the tastes.",Perry Creek 2001 Chardonnay (El Dorado County)
7437,"While this wine is labeled ""dry,"" it's technically not. There's some sugar left in it, it just seems dry if you compare it to the winery's regular, semi-dry version. Aromas of spiced pears and musky, evening flowers blend with flavors of pears, peaches and dried spices.",Glenora 2002 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
7438,"Dramatically dark, staining the glass with glycerine streaks, this wine  unabashedly celebrates its hot country origins. Considerable tannins  frame a core of berry fruit, with a zingy, peppery note that stimulates  the taste buds, but acidity is soft. At the same time, it retains a  rustic character typical of the varietal.",Imagery 2000 Artist Collection Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
7439,"Pine needle, lilac and some musk on the nose. Citrus is the driving force from then on. There's tangerine and some melon for flavor, and plenty or orange and passion fruit on the finish. A drink-now citrus ball that's full and flavorful.",Torres 2002 Viña Sol White (Penedès)
7440,"Smells and tastes like an inexpensive Aussie Shiraz, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. The texture is a little syrupy and thick, but it's a good, easy wine.",Maddalena 2000 Merlot (Central Coast)
7441,"The acidity is in the forefront, with little structure or fruit to fill it out. The fruit displays notes of milk chocolate, red plum and fresh herbs. The toast and oakspice ride nicely on the clean finish.",Ken Forrester 2001 Merlot (Stellenbosch)
7442,"This Riesling has refinement, elegance and freshness without huge complexity. It is a wine to drink now and over the next four or five years.",Hugel 2000 Riesling (Alsace)
7443,"Dark and extracted, with jammy berry flavors and a strongly earthy component, including tobacco, sage and tree bark. In the mouth this wine is very dry and pretty tannic, although the acidity is soft. A bit awkward, and not likely to improve in the cellar.",Imagery 1999 Sunny Slope Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Valley)
7444,"A plummy, semi-sweet dark red wine that could stand a bit of a chill in the fridge. It has a nice chocolatey edge that would be a good partner with dark chocolate desserts. Finishes clean and with good acidity.",Rosenblum 2001 Gallagher Ranch Black Muscat (California)
7445,"An eccentric version of Marlborough Riesling that tastes reminiscent of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with a green, underripe quality and some goosberry aromas on the nose. There's also a hint of riper, cinnamon-scented fruit and a clean, crisp finish.",Omaka Springs 2002 Riesling (Marlborough)
7446,"A pleasant sipper at a nice price, this fruity wine has flavors of cherries and plums, and is soft and rich. Has more complexity and depth than you'd think, and is a very good value.",Redwood 2000 Merlot (California)
7447,"This medium-bodied Chard has some butterscotch notes on the nose, but thankfully lacks similarly overpowering flavors on the palate. Some citrus flavors accent the wine's peachy core; finishes a little watery.",Yering Station 2000 Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)
7448,"Sometimes concept exceeds the wine itself, and this may be a case in point. The blend is odd, and the fact that each grape comes from a different part of Spain is potentially more odd. As for the wine, it has a nice perfume to it, courtesy of the Rhone varieties in the mix. And while the cherry/berry fruit is forward, it's maybe too sweet and basic in terms of length, structure and mouthfeel. Still, it's worth a try for the experimental tasters out there.",Bodegas Concavins 2000 Proyecto 4 Red (Conca de Barberà)
7449,"Aromas of match stick and green herbs don't deliver much fruit. This feels round and regular, with grassy flavors along with hints of green bean and canned pea. Unresolved pyrazines on the finish result in an herbal, green flavor.",Viña Maipo 2015 Gran Devoción Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
7450,"Light scents of fresh grass, white flowers, waxy melon and sweet orange dance in the bouquet of this easy-drinking white. Those notes continue through to the fruity palate, with a pleasant roundness to the midpalate. Drink now.",Wild Pig 2016 Viognier (Pays d'Oc)
7451,"Quite forward in  character, this opens with powerful scents of purple flowers, black berry, cherry and plum. The palate is juicy and fruit forward, with hints of sweet spice and berry preserves that carry through to the medium-length finish. Drink now.",Barton & Guestier 2016 B&G Réserve Grenache Noir (Pays d'Oc)

7453,"This informal red has delicate black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The simple palate suggests black plum and clove, with a touch of tobacco. It's not very intense and already extremely accessible, so drink soon.",CarlindePaolo 2016 Cursus Vitae  (Barbera d'Asti)
7454,"This leads with subtle black plum and cooking spice scents. The simple palate shows clove, tobacco and blackberry flavors. Drink soon.",Cascina Radice 2015 Roccanera  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
7455,"Aromas suggesting cellar floor, camphor and paraffin lead the nose of this wine. The camphor note follows through to the lean palate, along with red berry, ground clove and powdered sage flavors. Bracing tannins leave an astringent, drying finish.",Castello di Neive 2014  Barbaresco
7456,"Cherry and raspberry aromas are also stalky and gamy, a likely reflection of the 75% Syrah in this blend with Garnacha. A hard, grabby palate holds flavors of herbal plum and grape skins, while an obtuse finish tastes a little green.",Clos Pons 2015 Jan Petit Red (Costers del Segre)
7457,"Leathery red-fruit aromas turn more gritty and earthy with airing. This feels chunky and full, without much elegance. Plum and rubbery berry flavors finish with a chocolaty oak note.",Coleccion Privada 2015 Gran Reserva Pinot Noir (Maule Valley)
7458,"Minty berry aromas settle well and hold up to airing. This everyday Merlot is more than competent on the palate. Berry and spice flavors finish chewy, with standard ripeness and follow through.",Cuyen 2016 Merlot (Central Valley)
7459,"This wine's oak, toasted nut and menthol aromas carry over to its evolved palate, along with a coffee note and bracing tannins. It's shy on fruit richness and intensity.",Dante Rivetti 2012 Bricco di Neive Riserva  (Barbaresco)
7460,"After several years working in wine commerce and tourism, Céline Guguen-Brocard in 2013 studied winemaking. This is a bright result in partnership with Frédéric Gueguen, a former winemaker for her father, and Jean-Marc Brocard. This rosé is bright, crisp and full of cranberry fruit and tangy acidity. Drink now.",Domaine Gueguen 2016 Domaine Marie B.  (Bourgogne)
7461,"A simple, soft Chardonnay from the Mâconnais region, this is rounded. A touch of caramel adds extra flavor to the warm fruit. Green plum and melon dominate this wine that is ready to drink.",Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud 2016  Mâcon-Villages
7462,"Dusty earth tones add savoriness to fresh white peach in this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Gris. Fresh lemon-lime acidity maintains a lively, invigorating feel. Drink now.",Hosmer 2016 Estate Winery Pinot Gris (Cayuga Lake)
7463,"With Carmenère and País in the blend along with Carignan, this shows a lot of “old country” character, namely a saucy, savory nose with herbal red-berry hints. Herbal plum and peppery flavors fade on an undistinguished finish.",J. Bouchon 2016 Canto Sur Red (Maule Valley)
7464,"Yellow fruit and toast aromas set the scene for this soft, rounded wine. The apricot flavors are right there, lightly lifted by acidity. A gentle wine, it's ready to drink now.",Albert Bichot 2016  Mâcon-Villages
7465,"Heavy aromas of herbal berry fruits and wood smoke are rustic. This wine feels resiny and edgy, while saucy, oaky flavors of pancetta and tomato finish with notes of sausage, fennel and bacon.",TerraNoble 2013 Reserva Terroir La Higuera Carmenère (Maule Valley)
7466,"This offers bright raspberry jam, herb, pepper and spice aromas. It's full of vanilla flavors, seeming somewhat disjointed.",Kestrel 2013 Falcon Series Tribute Red (Yakima Valley)
7467,"This spritzy, 100% Viognier wine delivers melon, citrus zest and floral flavors. It drinks dry, fresh, clean and tart—an unusual interpretation of the variety.",Kestrel 2014 Falcon Series Frizzante White (Yakima Valley)
7468,"This wine's perfumed melon, white flower, vanilla and baking spice scents are followed by broad stone fruit flavors that finish tart. It goes down easy.",Kestrel 2016 Falcon Series Estate Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
7469,"This wine's oak, weedy underbrush, celery and vegetable broth aromas carry over to the lean palate, along with a roasted coffee bean note. Raspy tannins clench the finish.",La Spinetta 2013 Vigneto Bordini  (Barbaresco)
7470,"A white chocolate accent adds a touch of weight to the white cherry and watermelon aromas in the nose of this wine. The palate offers surprising weight, but it's countered by ample acidity and a citrus zest flavor that livens-up the finish.",Le Grand Noir 2016 Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
7471,"Smooth and creamy, this is a simple, soft wine. Clean, full of yellow fruits with just enough acidity, it is rounded, finishing with orange-zest tang. Drink now.",Loron et Fils 2016 Château de Mirande  (Mâcon-Villages)
7472,"This 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon shows cocoa, green herb and cherry notes, with a hint of volatility. It's medium bodied on the palate, with scratchy tannins.",Maryhill 2014 Les Collines Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
7473,"This wine's smoke, seaweed, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit aromas pop. The palate features easy-drinking fruit flavors, with gritty tannins to back them up.",Maryhill 2015 Winemaker's Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
7474,The deep-copper color and complex fruit aromas of this wine seem well matched with a rather broad texture and medium-full body. The raspberry flavors have a meaty savory accent.,Muddy Boot 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (California)
7475,"Oaky and robust, this wine takes on a confectionery route to tropical flavor and high-octane concentration, offering a thickness of texture and body. Stainless-steel fermented, it unveils secondary flavors of lime and white peach on the finish.",Napa Cellars 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
7476,"This wine's nose suggests game, forest floor, truffle and leather. It's tight and raw, offering roasted coffee bean, powdered sage, licorice and unripe cherry notes set against a backdrop of raspy tannins and firm acidity.",Pietro Rinaldi 2013 Santo Cristoforo  (Barbaresco)
7477,"This opens with prune, menthol, nail varnish and plastic aromas. The palate is tired and evolved, showing dried black cherry and fig flavors, with a hint of orange peel and worn tannins. It finishes short.",Punset 2012 Basarin Riserva  (Barbaresco)
7478,"This wine's subdued baking spice, clove and mature black-skinned fruit aromas follow through to the lively, simple palate. Round tannins provide easygoing support. Drink soon.",Cascina Radice 2015 S. Martino  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
7479,"Let's hope this isn't the future of California Pinotage, because the wine smells and tastes Porty, even though the alcohol isn't that high. There's a raisiny, stewed berry element that ends in a dry, harsh finish.",French Hill 2005 Premium Select Pinotage (Sierra Foothills)
7480,"A difficult wine to like, as it lacks charm. There's something rustic in the orange marmalade and sugared herb tea flavors that accentuates the tannins and acids, making the finish harsh.",Grgich Hills 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley)
7481,"This thin, light effort carries flavors of baby aspirin, or orange candy. It's one dimensional, bearing little varietal character.",Bridgeview 2006 Viognier (Southern Oregon)
7482,"This is a candy sweet, soft wine with flavors of pineapples, orange blossoms, apricots, peaches and caramel. Drink now.",Castoro Cellars 2006 Roussanne (Paso Robles)
7483,"Really too ripely sweet and hot for comfort, even though the alcohol is only 14%. Tastes like oven-baked cherries and blackberries, with lots of caramel.",Vin Nostro 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
7484,"Kalbarri's Cab boasts plenty of red-berry flavors and a soft, easygoing, maybe even slightly sweet, finish.",Kalbarri 2006 Bin Select 513 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)
7485,"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Harveys NV Fino Light Sherry (Jerez)
7486,"Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.",Septima 2006 Tempranillo (Mendoza)
7487,"There is not much going on here. As with most California Pinots in this price range, the Erath is a stripped-down, pale and insubstantial take on the grape. Pinots may be light and still profound, but this is simply light and watery.",Erath 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
7488,"This is an odd duck for Gewürz; lacking any of the floral character generally associated with that grape. It's lemony and slightly sweet, with good acid. It makes a pleasant, if generic white wine to accompany spicy noodles or light seafood.",Bridgeview 2006 Gewürztraminer (Southern Oregon)
7489,"Earthy, spicy aromas lead, rolling into smoky layers of typical Cab flavors. Berry, tobacco and touches of sweet oak give it okay complexity.",Snake River 2003 Arena Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Idaho)
7490,"A good balance of berry, spice and fruit recommend this; it has balance and structure and a degree of complexity that will lend it to pairing with heartier dishes. An interesting and fun wine.",Vivác Winery 2005 V. Single Vineyard Nebbiolo (New Mexico)
7491,"This smells of burnt match and soap, with flavors of very tart citrus and hints of pear and orange. There's plenty of acid but not much weight to the mid-palate.",Bridgeview 2006 Blue Moon Pinot Gris (Oregon)
7492,"Sharp and jammy, with blackberry and cherry flavors. It's a simple, direct wine that needs a big, juicy cheeseburger.",Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Merlot (California)
7493,"Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.",Celler La Bollidora 2005 Plan B Red (Terra Alta)
7494,"The nose on this Merlot is earthy, with savory scents of mushroom, soft fruit and spice, but on the palate, the wine could use a bit more structure and presence. Overall though, it's balanced and friendly, and will pair well with myriad mild-flavored dishes.",Chaddsford 2005 Merlot (Pennsylvania)
7495,"An awkward wine, high in acid, with grapefruit, green tea and dried thyme aromas and flavors. Okay in its own way, but doesn't seem quite ripe.",Pacific Oasis 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
7496,"Sharp and rustic, with medicinal, LifeSaver candy cherry flavors that finish with a scour of acidity.",Shannon Ridge 2006 Grenache (Lake County)
7497,"Norman Conquest, get it? The wine itself is too soft, and lacks the tannin-acid structure needed for balance. Too bad, because the oak-infused cherry and blackberry flavors are fine.",Norman 2003 Conquest Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
7498,"Lightly tropical, with peach, citrus and pineapple aromas. The palate offers mostly sharp citrus flavors of lime and orange, and the finish holds onto that theme.",Funky Llama 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
7499,"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley)
